Hello
Hi
The movie is how to train your dragon. I haven seen it, but I am sure my kids have.
Have you seen it?
Yeah I saw it years ago
Cool, looks like it got a good rotten tomatoes score and I think they made a sequal.
I was still a kid back then and I remember liking it a lot
I haven't seen the sequel
Has more big names than I thought too, with Gerard Butler, Jonah Hill and Kristin Wiig
Did you happen to read the book too?
No, I didn't realize there was a book
I'm tempted to check it out now though
Me too. I would like to read the book first.
It's definitely a good coming of age movie. The boy has to become a man by killing a dragon, but he becomes friends with the dragon and doesnt want to kill it
Cool, sounds like an interesting story.
They were definitely trying to promote a message of not being blindly forced into a way of life/culture, just because the older men thought that way
He ends up convincing the others to live in harmony with the dragons instead of killing them
The battle scenes are really cool, the animation was great for that movie
I didn't know that it was the same people who made Lilo & Stitch
I'm waiting for my son to be old enough to get it. He likes dinosaurs now
Might like dragons too
The main dragon, Toothless, looks very friendly
He acts almost like a dog
I think I was probably 13-14  when I saw it
Yea, I actually might watch it myself instead.
I may have had it on for background noise at some point. I honestly dont recall
I'm trying to figure out who Jonah Hill was in the movie
IMDB says he was one of the kids in the dragon-training classes
They all had to take classes about how to kill their first dragon
He is quite funny too.
Definitely, have you seen Wolf of Wall Street?
Yea, lol
For the scenes where he snorted cocaine, they were using vitamin D power, and he had snorted so much of it he had a Vitamin D overdose and had to go to the hospital
Have the documents changed for you? The task says new documents will appear but mine have been the same this whole time
Yea, they have become longer
I have never heard of a Vitamin D overdose.
thats funny
hi
see any good movies lately?
hello?
Hey! Not really, I just Batman vs. Superman. The 27% Rotten Tomatoes score is fitting.
oh, i havent seen that one, tell me more
why was it so bad?
Well, it's the sequel to Man of Steel. There's a lot of meaningless action and not much else.
hi
hello 
so what did you think about jaws
I think the movie is a classic
yes I enjoyed the horor elements
yea I was really spooked when I first saw the film as a kid
i really love how the shark is a big threat to them
yea and they had planes and everything and the shark was like godzilla haha
so what's next
it seems like jaws may not get another movie
really? I thought they were making all sorts of remakes 
I did not here about that and also  scene on the beach was very scarey
for me when the guys were trapped on the boat was what I found most scary 
lots of places that I would be very scared to be at in real life
maybe if there were sharks 
yeah lol
I try to stay away from the water myself to avoid sharks I dont find surfing to be worth the risk
yeah I can't swim at all so it is out of the picture for me
so water is always a fear of mine
yea 
I do like watching the waves
surprised how they needed a professional to catch the shark
all they needed was a bunch of guys with beer and guns lol
yeah
seems funny lol
wonder where the next page gonna appear
maybe 5mins
quint died right at the end too
that was dumb of them to try and use a strychnine on the shark
it was a good movie though
Hi

Hello
Hello
Letâs talk
Which dragon was your favorite?
Iâm not sure. 
Night Fury?
Not sure what that is exactly 
Night Fury was the main one...the "hero" of the movie.
Do you remember his name?
Nope
It was "toothless"! :)
Donât think Iâve seen the movie you are taking about 
Oh, well you should watch it!
What is it?
You can watch it in 3D, or 2D.
It's called "How to Train Your Dragon".
Oh
It's really great fun for all ages.
Who is in it?
Is it animated?
Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson...etc.
Yes, it's animated.
When was it made?
2010
Is it a comedy or more serious?
Definitely a comedy.
It has some really funny parts, but serious stuff too.
Interesting. As it deals with dragons 
98% on Rotten Tomatoes!
How long is the movie?
I'm not sure, but around 2 hours I think...probably a little less.
Might have to see it. Do you recommend in 2D or 3D?
Since it's animation, 3D (if you like 3D) is really great.
Some other voice actors you might recognize: TJ Miller, Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse
It has some really cool battle scenes and a lot of "feeling" for an animated film.
Any other questions? I have a document in front of me with a bunch of info about the movie...
It was based upon a book.
hi
Hello!
how are u ?
good, you?
im ok 
have you seen this movie?
so have u watched ..
nope
but i do like angelina jolie
i havent either, but i love the story of sleeping beauty
me too
iy has 51 in rotten tomatoes
so hmm
not that good
5.7 out of 10. yikes
i know
so this movie is more about the villan
is a dark fantasy film
yes
wow
so she was originally a fairy
yes
i cant believe its been so long since this movie came out
she fells in love with a human it says
i know
right
and then her wings are cut off
i think i only heard about this movie once
oh wow
ah man phillips kiss doesnt work
and her lover betrayed her
stefan is auroras father
and maleficent loves him
yea
i feel bad for her now
oh boy
she sends stefan to his death
yeah i feel bad too
i know its different, but i like the old fashioned sleeping beauty too much
i dont like how they changed it around
yea
 they changed it for it to only get a 5.1 rating
this film wanted to break the stereotype
but it was too much
righy
right
they fixed it when it wasnt broken
yea
it was too much
and i havent heard about that director
i wonder if this is the first movie he made
he actually sounds familiar
it probably takes a lot to direct a movie like this
i think u are right
but its metacritic score was 56/100. ow
really low
from what i hear angelina jolie performed really well in it
well i love her
im a girl
not like that
lol
haha
she is a good actress
i think she is a great person and actres
there is a scene where aurora is a little girl and she goes up to maleficent
and they had to use Angelinas daughter
oh really ???
because her daughter was the only one who wouldnt get scared and run away lol
so i like that
yea
but the critical responses
it is interesting that, like frozen, a prince was not needed for the true love scenario
it was like a mother daughter love
and i love that
which i really like
i hate that u need a prince all the time
to make " everything  better "
me too
it seems like a very entertaining movie
and i will have to watch it
i might give it a chance this weekend 
me too
but i dont my 2 year old would stand still
This movie is awesome!

The Genre is a Biographical Sports Drama. 
Are you into those?

sure
The Blind Side is a 2009 American biographical sports drama film written and directed by John Lee Hancock, based on the Book The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game by Michael Lewis. The storyline features Michael Oher, an offensive lineman who was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens of the NFL. The film follows Oher from his impoverished upbringing, through his years at Wingate Christian School, his adoption by Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy, to his position as one of the most highly coveted prospects in college football, then finally becoming first-round pick of the Ravens. It stars Quinton Aaron as Big Mike, Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy, Tim Mcgraw as Sean Tuhoy.
that sounds interesting
does the movie have a happy ending?
The film received moderately positive reviews, with critics praising Sandra Bullock's performance. It scored 69% and average; 6.1/10 on Rotten tomatoes
Yes, it has a very happy ending.
awesome
then i might watch it
did you see it when it was released?
Sounds good. I think you would enjoy it very much. I know I did. I really like Sandra Bullock Movies
I did see it when it was released.
Yeah, I loved her acting in Miss Congeniality
Yes, one of my favorites. A lot of her older ones as well.
Do you have any other questions about the Movie
?
How long is the movie?
It was pretty long, maybe a little over 2 hours.
wow, thats a long movie
It's one of those movies that you can rewatch over and over and not get tired of it.
It feels like Watching it for the first time, every time. 
oh so you have seen it more than once?
Oh yes, a few times. 
Hello!
Hello there, how are you today?
I'm pretty good. Seems like you have the document this time. Do you have a movie you'd like to talk about?
So the movie is How to Train Your Dragon, have you seen this before?
I haven't but I've heard good things about it!
What's it about?
Well let see, It came out in 2010 and was produced by Dreamworks, it is a fully animated show.
Dreamworks huh? I do enjoy a lot of their movies. I assume from the title that it has something to do with dragons?
It is set back in the Viking Days, and it has a teenage character named Hiccup, who finds a wounded dragon and befiends it.
befriends
Oh the old boy and his dog story but with a dragon huh? That sounds pretty interesting. Was it received pretty well?
The movie is a bit unique as it uses 3D animation , its a coming of age comedy, the same producers of Lilo and Stitch created it.
It seemed to do ok it got a 98% on rotten tomatoes, but an A in Cinema score
I see! That sounds pretty good then.  You said it was animated but do you know who provides the voices?
Actually some well known names come to mind, like hiccup is played by Jay Baruchel. And Gerard Butler as the chief Viking, America Ferrera plays a friend of Hiccup. Hiccup is the main character of course.
That's really cool. I'm sure they do a great job. I really like animated movies so I might have to check that one out sometime.
I have actually seen it and I would recommend it
You mentioned that he befriends a dragon. Can you tell me anything more about that?
Sure, the Dragons name is Night fury. And the movie doesn't have much of a storyline, but it has battles between tamed and evil ones.
Do youlike dragons?
I see, that sounds pretty interesting though. I do! Dragons are usually the bad guys in a film so it might be cool to get a film with a good one
And vikings as well. It sounds like a very unique setting.
YES, The isle of Berk is their village, and they are afraid of the dragons because they steal their livestock, so when they come upon the dragons they usually kill them.
Oh no! But I guess Hiccup finds out that not all dragons are bad in the end?
See Hiccup is scrawny and cant fight because he is scrawny, so he makes things, apparatuses if you will.
but he isnt very good at it
I see, an awkward kid makes a friend of a dragon huh? That does sound very interesting.
I usually like animated films that have a good main character so this might be right up my alley.
SO during one of those attacks Hiccup shoots at a dragon, and believes he has shot it down. Finds it later, not dead, but damaged. Helpes the dragon fly again then finds out that thedragonsare being Bullied by a bigger one.
I see! I bet he works together with his new dragon friend to help them out then.
So Hiccup and his friends decide they are going to help out Hiccups friendly Dragon and they all learn how to train awkward dragons and go off to fight the biggest Dragon which they call Red Death.
That does sound cool!
And it looks like we're done
It's been nice talking with you!
Have a good day.
good morning!
Good morning!
say, do you like romantic drama?
I believe I am the only person who has not seen this movie!
I do, but my wife enjoys it more for sure!
I'm surprised the Notebook only got a 50% rating, it has become so popular.
indeed, its gone down as a great, for some reason 
ryan gosling was just too convincing i suppose
I do like the actors, both Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams.
great thespians to be sure
Have you read the 1994 novel?
i have not!
I do like period pieces though, so being set in 1940 appeals to me.
indeed. gosling has a knack for them! big fan of gangster squad myself
Yes that is more down my alley also.
So I guess they play the young lovers, who then become the older people narrating the story?
I assume you've seen it.
i guess so! all i have is this document, and that scene where ryan gosling is in the rain. thats all i know!
Haha ok me too!
but yeah, the score is a good question
i assumed it was the citizen kane of romance movies
i guess time didnt tell
Wow so he gets killed in WWII
Oh wait his friend is killed
I'm already confused
needs more time travel
seabrook eh
ever been to the carolinas?
i went to the outer banks once in North carolina
No all I know is from Dawson's Creek lol
It seems like a great spot to set a romance movie though
I may have to actually watch this, I'm slightly intrigued
pretty beaches
yeah, i feel like its one to cross off the list, heh
Now we know the ending though. The mom shows her the intercepted letters and all is forgiven.
clearly gotta see it all go down, right?
some day, some day.
Wow so this must have been one of Gosling's early movies. I didn't realize it was that old.
Hello
 iHi
This is an interesting movie
it is, it's a very unusual movie
Yes, did you like it?
since the human fell in love with a creature
I did
I though it was very different than most movies I watch
how did you feel?
I wasn't in love with it, a little weird for my taste
But I appreciated how unique it was
so did I, and the acting was done very well
Guilllermo del Toro certainly has an active imagination
Yes, the actors were very good
it was interesting seeing them communicate in sign language
Yes, I did as well
what did you think about the reviews?
I didn't really read the reviews
But everyone I know that saw it was highly recommending it
I generally like to see movies that are so popular among my friends
it was, and reading the reviews made me realize more about the movie
Hmm I'll have to check them out
what did you think about how she keep him alive?
I did seem like there was a lot of complexity to the story line and theme that I may have missed
In the bathtub?
I thought it was sweet that she was caring for him
yes, I thought so also
however the romantic scenes were definitely a bit odd to me
Very sad about the car though...
it wasn't like a movie I normally watch
Yes, it was a little strange at times
what did you think about the ending?
But, I agree that it is nice to see a movie that is new and original
I liked the ending, although I though the last few scene were a bit gruesome .
I agree
it was kind of a happy ending though
which I appreciated
Hello!
Have you seen Catch Me If You Can?
No, I haven't!
It's great. I am a big Leonardo DiCapario fan. Do you like him?
I do! I find him very attractive and talented!
It's based on the story of a real con man.
Oh really! 
That sounds interesting!
who else is in it?
Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken.
Also Amy Adams, though I don't know her well.
Oh wow, I loved Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump!
She's done a lot of movies with fairy tale characters
This movie got 98% from Rotten Tomatoes.
Oh that's good!
I liked it as it didn't take itself too seriously. It's actually very funny.
Oh, that's the best type of movie!
When did it come out?
I'm shocked since I haven't heard about it
2002
Oh wow! An oldie then!
I guess you could say that.
You can probably see it on Netflix.
Oh, that's much easier for me!
I'm busy so I don't have time to go to the movies
Where I live, nothing good ever plays.
Oh that's unfortunate.
I like that it based on a real character. At one point he steals 2.8 million dollars.
Oh, I forgot. Steven Spielberg is the director.
Oh that's cool!
I just re-watched back to the future 
he
he's an amazing director
I agree. You can't go wrong with one of his movies.
hello
Hello
The movie you should see is Zootopia
What is zootopia about?
Its about an optimistic rabbit that joins the Zootopia Police Department. While out she runs into a red fox that is also a small time con artist played by Jason Bateman. The movie follows their adventure Zootopia.
that sounds really interesting. How does the movie end?
would you watch it again?
I would watch it again. I saw it in theaters so I am not positive on how it ends but i know that it ends with the Rabbit officer proving that she may be small but she wont be intimidated and will do her job to the best of her abilities.
she sounds like a great officer.
She was quite inspiring. 
who plays all the voices in the movie?
Ginnifer Goodwin is Officer Judy Hopps, Jason Bateman plays Nick Wilde, Idris Elba is Chief Bogo, and Jenny Slate is Dawn Bellwether.
those are all great voices. Do you think this movie is okay for kids?
I think it is a great movie for kids and adults alike.
would you consider it to be a comedy?
Yes.
would you recommend it to your best friend?
Yes.
do you think that they will make a second movie of this?
There is some potential for a second movie. But I am not sure what they would use for a premise. 
thats very true, a sequal is easier said than done.
They cannot try to use the little guy beats the big guy in the next one since the officer proved her self already.
maybe a little guy can beat the officer
like the rocket snail
That could be true, but do we want to see a movie where the bad guy wins?
true but than they could make a third movie where the officer learns how to defeat the guy eventually.
I see your point. I fear that you may dissuade people from watching a third movie if they were put off from seeing the villain win in the second movie.
It does open up the plot to a third movie but would rather see a cliffhanger than the enemy win.
thats true! no one at the end of the day wants to see the enemy win.
Do you think there was a hidden message in the movie?
I think the message was to be patient and not judge people or in the movies case animals based on the stereotypes that you have gathered. 
hey!
are you still there?
Hello
what took you so long dude?
yes i just finished reading, i am a slow reader
Oh great
let's roll
have you seen the wolf of wall street?
no but according to the review it does not sound too good
talking based on the ratings i would say it is a decent movie though
whaddya think
have you seen it\
a 78% from rotten tomatoes doesn't seem cheap to me
whats a rotten tomatoes\]
Hello!
Hey!
What movie are we talking about?
How to Train Your Dragon.
Oh, I have not seen that. What is it about?
Are you there?
The Movie is an animation based loosely on a British book series directed by Chris Sanders, with battles by dragons and coming of age.
What is the name of the main character?
I'm not sure.
You should watch this movie because it's a thrilling action-adventure sage with exhilarating 3D movie!
Is it meant to be a children's movie or one for adults?
Its a children's movie.
Do you know what age group? I may want to have my children see it.
Starts off with a 15 year old son of the Village Chieftain and I would say anywhere from 7 and up.
Rated PG?
It has a rating of 7.9 and a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes!
If you didn't know it came out in 2010.
Well then I guess we won't be seeing it in 3-D lol.
Have you seen it?
I have not seen it yet but it goes on to say that the Stock the Vast is a dragon killer and instead of killing a rare dragon he sets it free.
Interesting, what is the dragon's name?
Hiccup another character goes to a forest where the dragon was originally stuck and gradually tames the dragon which is a Nigh Fury.
His name is toothless for his retractable teeth.
That sounds cute. Maybe I can have my 5 year old see it.
Absolutely Hiccup goes on to subdue a captive dragon in his final test, but does not harm it, Stoick on the other hand angers the dragon into attacking Hiccup!
Did you want to know more?
Do you usually watch animated movies?
I would love to know more. My children love animated films
Toothless the dragon comes to protect Hiccup but ends up getting captured by the Vikings...
Stoick is Hiccups father and Hiccup ends up telling him by accident that  oothless knows where the dragons nest is and sets off with Toothless the dragon while disowning his son in the process.
Toothless*
Do the humans end up living in harmony with the dragons?
The Vikings expel most of the dragons but attacked by the Red Death until Hiccup, Astrid fly in riding the dragons provide cover . Hiccup almost drowns trying to break Toothless free from a sinking ship but Stoick saves them both and then reconciles with his son.
Toothless and Hiccup destroy the Red Death but he ends up getting hurt, giving him a prosthesis and the end up living in harmony!
That definitely sounds like something my five year old would like. What is the Red Death?
Red Death is another dragon who tries to take out the vikings.
But glad I could persuade you to watch the movie!
Thanks!
Hi are you ready to get started? This is a batman vs superman superhero crossover movie. Are you familiar with those superheroes?
We are here to discuss Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice
Yes i am familar with the characters but some of the actors i have never heard of
I think it sounds like an amazing movie. I love superheroes. I think some of the critics are too harsh. It was a good plot line. I am familiar with Ben Affleck but none of the others. 
I wish they would have used more famous people. 
I would agree though that it was not as good as man of steel. The plot line of that was amazing!
Ben Affleck is the only actor I recognize great plot very harsh critcs
I agree. I didn't completely understand why Batman and Superman fought though. 
Rotten Tomatoes list it as 27%and average with a 4.9 out of 10. The critcs must be weird. Yeah i couldnt figure out the fight but think it was because superman accidentally killed bruce waynes dad
I thought it was worth a meteoritic score more than 44. That seemed low! That makes sense. I would be mad if someone tried to kill one of my family members. 
hello?
Yeah me to it did also have a unique spin on character of Lex Luthor who just seems to go doown hill the whole movie. I like how the critic talked about Lex (who is supermans arch enemy ) because he compared him to the joker and riddler (who are batmans arch enemies
Then he tops off the crazy part by comparing him to Mark Zuckerburg. 
Ohh. I liked that too. I like how they always try to biring in the government official s
Yeah im still here just slow typer
Do you like batman or superman better in the movie?
Actually superman 
How bout u
I grew up watching the justice league cartoons in thelate 70s and early 80s in which alll the superheros worked together.
I love batman
He is so mysterious 
Sorta ironic that they become enemies 
Yes he is very mysterious
It is. Its not what I expected at all
I expected more like the avengers where a bunch of heroes work together 
I don't really like that they are enimies
Especially to the point where batman was going to kill superman 
Me either but superman pretty much started it the article says clark kent was trying to make bruce wayne and batman look bad thru his news articles
You know though to be honest if you look at the way the world is today so full of bad it makesperfect sense in a world view to have them as enemies. 
I guess so. They do have polar opposite personalities. One is a humble farm boy and the other is a rich executive 
I could see why they clash in that aspect, but I guess I don't imagine them interacting very much in superhero world. 
It says in the 3rd part that at supermans funeral that bruce way e apol9gizes to lois lane saying that he failed superman
DUUHHHH well yeah he failed him if he killed him lol
I would feel like if I failed someone if I let them die too. Haha. I like the mysterious dirt levitating though 
Haha 
Thats what I was thinking 
Little humor there
Have u seen this movie 
No have you? is that the end?
I can't tell
Oh yeah. It is.
I wonder if there will be a sequel 
Yes watched it 3 times its a tearjerker for me when superman dies
I feel like good superhero movies need sequels 
I dunno could be a sequel 
Like how superman didnt really die he just hibernated til he found out a way to smooth it over with batman
Hey!
Hello!
This movie received mixed reviews
What do you think about it?
I think I might be the only girl who doesn't like the notebook
I liked the timeline of the film but there were unnessasery amount of screen time spent on pointless moments.
Haha okay. I really like Ryan and Rachel so I'm assuming this movie is good. I haven't seen it yet though because the trailer looked cheesy.
Both actors are excellent in the film 
I haven't read the book either.
Nice
I think I just have a biased opinion with Nicholas sparks books Made into films
Do you read his books?
I think it's cute that he tries to buy her a house in scene 1
When i was 15 I read a few 
Allie's mom seems rude
What do you think of scene 1
Upper class family's in films always appear to be rude
Yeah
The ending I think really does it for alot of people 
Okay so this is during the WOrld Wars
I like the vintage look in the first scenes
It's getting sad at this point
I think is 50/50 either you love it or hate it
It seems like Noah's  kind of like Gatsby in this scene since he's convinced a house is what will bring Allie
back to him
Material things 
Anne interferes too much
I'm glad Allie ends up with Noah
I feel bad for Lon
What do you think of the last scene?
Eh, this film is like the love in titanic 
Hahah
There are great moments but over all the film is a bore
I see
The ending is one of those great moments 
That's good to know
It looks like we're done
Nice talking to you
Hi! Today we'll be discussing Batman vs Superman!
Great! Do I need to watch any other DC Comic movies prior to watching this one?
I can't honestly say, however, as a critic noted "it's better than Man of Steel but not as good as The Dark Knight". 
Who are the lead actors? 
It follows 2013's Man of Steel so you would probably need to see it just to be safe...
Batman, Superman and even wonder woman makes an appearance!
Haha! Do you know which actors play Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman in this movie? 
Ben Affleck plays Batman/Bruce Wayne, Henry Cavill plays Clark Kent/Superman. Gal Gadot stars in the film as well as Diane Lane as Martha Kent and Amy Adams as Louis Lane. Are you a fan of any of those actors?
All but Ben Affleck. Lest super hero movie I saw him in was Daredevil and that was rough. Let's hope he's better in this. 
Though, I am a Michael Keaton fan when it comes to Batman. I suspect anyone playing Batman who is not Keaton will be weird to me. 
Most of the critics wasn't too fond of it, but CinemaScore have it a rating of B, which I feel is about right for this film!
Have you seen it?
I have and would grade it a solid B, just as CinemaScore did. Are you a fan of director Zack Snyder?
I'm not sure. What other movies has he directed? 
He directed Batman vs Superman. The film takes place 18 months after the battle between General Zod and Superman. Superman becomes a controversial figure while Clark Kent learns of Batman's form of justice and seeks to expose him via Daily Planet articles. 
Has he directed anything else besides the Batman or Superman movies?
I can't honestly say. I know he directed this film while David S. Goyer and Chris Terrio cowrote it. 
Batman and Superman are enemies in this film? 
They are - Lex Luthor, who is obsessed with defeating Superman, basically manipulates them into fighting each other.
Whose side is Wonder Woman on?
Well to be honest, Batman has Superman beat and just before he can kill Superman, Superman utters "save martha" to which Lane enterenters and explains Martha is his mother. Batman rescues Martha while Superman confronts Luther on the scout ship. At this point, Wonder Woman hasn't debuted yet 
Dang! Crazy that Batman has Superman beat! Isn't Batman just a millionaire with a lot of fancy gadgets? Superman at least has real super powers. You would think that would give him a one-up. Did Batman have kryptonite  or something?
I do very much agree with you! It is puzzling but Batman has a spear he plans to kill superman with just before he utters the "Save Martha" line, halting Batman from killing him.
Do the join forces after that?
they*
They do thankfully - Batman actually saves Martha while Superman travels to the scout ship to Confront Luther.
Does he kill Luther? 
Luther was also the one who kidnapped Martha. He doesn't kill Luther but Luther is arrested to which Batman confronts him while he's in prison, warning that he'll always be watching.
So basically leaving an opening for another movie in the franchise?
I've heard debates on Superman's and Batman's outfits in this movie. Some say that they are awesome and some say that they are ridiculous and too different form their b eloved originals. What are your thoughts on this?
They do... Sadly, Superman dies, however, Bruce Wayne intends to form a team of Metahumans, starting with the Metahumans he found in Luthor's files to protect the world in Sueprmans absence. 
While it did seem like 153 minutes of a grown man whacking two dolls together, I still found it better than Man of Steel.
Wait, Superman dies? How??
Well to be honest, at the end of the film, the dirt atop Sueprman's coffin does begin to levitate! I think we're at the finish line! I enjoyed chatting with you about Batman vs Superman! I highly recommend you seeing it one day. If you agree with CinemaScore, they rated it a B so I think you'll enjoy it and encourage you to watch it! Take care and have a great day!
Hello
hello 
did you like the movie The Shape of Water
Have you seen the Shape of Water? I don't particularly like the movie. Its a bit to slow for my taste and a lot weird. I have watched it. But I would not watch it a second time
I haven't watched it   
what is it about
Its about Sally Hawkins who is a mute janitor at a lab and she falls in love with a experiment, a fish-man. Octavia Spencer is her friend and basically helps her escape.
that sounds cool 
You have to talk about the document in order to get the money and move on
ok
So my question is, what character does Michael Stuhlbarg play in the Shape of Water
Michael Stuhlbarg plays Dimitri mosenkov , a soviet spy working as a scientist
I find it interesting that Elisa , as a child, was found in a river with wounds around her neck.   
And later on she connects with a humanoid amphibian. Maybe she connects with the thing because she is like it.  
what do you think
Hi.
Hello, have you seen the movie Dunkirk?
Not yet, have you?
It is written and directed by Christopher Nolan.
I have not, but I am very interested.
I did notknow he wrote it.
He filmed it on a unique format film stock as well, so it's especially suited for something like an IMAX experience
I wonder if it is still in theaters?
It came  out a while back now.
I think..
I do not think so. And without it, there are several critical responses as well because it does not have any sentimentality
Oh so are you saying some critics didn't like  it?
Yes. It got a really high score on Rotten Tomatoes, but there are several other who criticize it for being overwhelming
hmm. do you how what it's rating  on rotten tomatoes is?
Both overwhelming in the cinimatics while not providing any one character to get attached to
Probably more driven by the action.
It is about a nearly impossible evacuation, and you see all three types of assistance - naval, air, and land
It is based on what truly happened at dunkirk, right?
Yes. It is very true to the story.
I am always hesitant to see very  real war related movies.
It is a lot to handle.
There are a few characters who get names, like Mr. Dawson and his sons Peter and George, who set out on a boat to help, but few characters who get followed throughout
So very different from nolan's batman.
Very much so. While it seems Dunkirk may have been a technical success, you do not walk away feeling like it
Any known actors in dunkirk?
There is commander Bolton, who confirms that the 300,000 have been evacuated. It was ten times more than had been hoped for
Who plays him?
Mr Dawson gets acknowledgement for having saved so many men
Hmmm.. That I do not know
These names are unknown to me.
Ahh, I do see it here. Does Aneurin Barnard ring a bell? 
Hmm , no.
I am surprised there is no big name star.
I'm looking at the list of the biggest roles, and they are not stars. But that goes with the anonymity of all of the characters really
Maybe it is a comment on war itself.
Hehe, I see it of course ends with an article being read, written by Churchill. 
So many movies and shows involving Churchill lately!
Interesting. 
yes it does seem that way.
I guess you have to watch dunkirk than darkest hour.
Did you like the movie?
Yes I did.
Who was your favorite actor in the film?
Christopher W alken
Do you like crime films?
yes I really do.
 A re they one of your favorites?
Not particularly
This movie wasn't too bad though
 What was the name of the Pan-American airline pilot?
Frank Abagnale
Oh, now I remember it was Frank.
I enjoyed his movies
 actually I enjoy most of all this movie by Steven Spielberg.
He's a very good director
 Although it wasn't one of his major movies it was one that was very enjoyable.
yes he really is a good director.
Christopher Walken  is also a good actor.
I agree
 The  background for many of the scenes which is just incredible.
I wonder how he felt when he was told that his father had died.
I know. This would be crazy if it happened in real life 
He was probably really sad
I feel the same way as you do regarding that particular scene.
it was fairly uncomfortable when I recognize that she had left his father for another man.
 T hat gave me the feeling of the real bummer.
I felt the same way
I'm glad he ended up happy though
I especially enjoy the sea when Frank gave himself up.
 yes I can comprehend.
 There's always a great deal of action going on the movies that took place in New York City.
That makes sense. New york city is a busy place
 All I enjoyed the point whereas he was working at the FBI.
That part was exciting
 I had not realized that the check Carl was carrying was a fake.
yes, is very exciting.
Was it not Frank that pointed the fact that the check Carl was carrying was fake
Yes it was
.I also enjoyed the students seem where Frank was offered a deal by the FBI.
I did too
And when he tries to be a pilot
 It was pretty cool the way that he was able to work out the remainder of his prison sentence.
yes can you imagine him being a pilot.
Yeah I agree 
No I can't haha
what do you suppose is on his mind at that time?
He's probably just on an adrenaline high from doing things he isn't supposed to
Kind of wrapped up in the excitement
 I do agree.
 Frank, is quite a character.
I can't believe it's based on a real person
What about the part when he poses as a substitute teacher?
 Yes, he was quite a person.
 Frank lived his life to the fullest.
Oh yeah, I forgot about  the teacher part
I wonder what it was like to be his students
It seems like he had a very enjoyable childhood.
 Being a student of Frank probably was pretty cool.
It was probably fun
I would definitely agree, fun  it was.
I did know Frank  had it in him to teach.
Yeah 
He seems really smart
I would love to have been a student at that time
Me too
T he scene where Frank is returning home by way of flying on a plane from prison must have felt funny. to him.
Is anyone there?
hi
Hi
Hi
Have you seen the movie mean girls ?
we are supposed to speak about "MEAN GIRLS" ?
yes
Yes me too 
It s comedy and a fun romance 
yeap
It was highly praised by the critics 
yeap, but in my opinion
It was named the fifty greatest teen comedies 
My favorite part was the girls hating on each other 
it is too much viewed
I liked it too
^^
Rotten tomatoes gave it 84 percent so it seems it could have been hated and liked as well 
but too many movies like it are made
even if it is correct
I think Lindsey Lohan who plays candy is a good actress in this 
Do you often watch this kind of mov ie ?
Mean girls is similar to most favorite teen shows.  Rachael madams iplays Regina George 
exactly
Amanda seyfriend plays Karen he role was more quiet 
that is what I think
Whatâs interesting is this was a non fiction book 
It got a score of 66/100 which is not wonderful either 
that is the mark I would have given
The burn book was an interesting concept 
The cinema score was a a - 
Hey! Have you ever seen The Social Network?
I have not, but I know it was filmed in 2010.
Have you seen it?
I personally enjoyed it. It tells the story of the founding of Facebook. Do you like movies based on reality?
I do. I also like Jesse Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake. The movie got good reviews, so maybe I will watch it.
I really would recommend it myself. It was extremely good. Jesse Eisenberg plays Zuckerburg in such an intense way. It's a great film.
Did you read the book the movie was based on? The Accidental Billionaires?
I just learned it was based on the book today. I'm definitely going to have to read it. 
Apparently, the biographical part of the movie isn't exactly true to life, since the movie was based on the book. Mark Zuckerberg had no part in contributing to the movie.
That is certainly interesting to know. I always wondered about it myself. Apparently, Saverin was the only consultant with any true to life information.
Was it weird to see Armie Hammer play two people?
It was! To be honest with you they did such a good job that I had a hard time realizing they were both Armie Hammer. He is an amazing actor. I also think Facesmash is a hilarious startup name.
It is! and what a crazy story... basically he got dumped and made millions off of trying to get even with her.
How contentious of a person. Based off what you know of him would you have be friendly with him if you were in school with him at the time?
Hmm... probably not. He doesn't seem to have good luck keeping friends. How ironic as he invented Facebook. Do you think you'd have been friends?
Absolutely not 1
I thought it was ironic as well. I couldnt believe it. 
The scene where Christy Lee says Facebook me is kinda funny, too. It certainly beats facesmash me.
Agreed. It makes sense, but I had no idea how much help Zuckerberg had along the way... Especially from one of the founders of Napster!
Justin Timberlake plays him so well too. I never knew about it either, but keep in mind it's based off the book. Who knows how much he actually was involved.
That is true. I wonder if Mark Zuckerberg actually invited Sean Parker to live at Facebook headquarters!
I love how he was doing it from a house. You know that much happened. If Sean Parker was there, who knows. I love how tech company start ups are out of houses. I wonder what the other continent was they were trying to expand to first.
I think that it is pretty funny considering the success he gained... and "Thefacebook"? First Facesmash, then Harvard Connection then Thefacebook... yikes!
Thefacebook is just rotten. It seems like Zuckerberg really shafted everyone else in the situation.
It's kind of creepy how he just waited for Albright to accept the friend request, too.
It's really sort of sad to me. He hasn't really changed from the beginning of the story.
That's how I feel. I'm not surprised he had to do a settlement.
He founded the biggest social network the world has ever seen, but he seems like a person who people hate.
Extremely misanthropic. I would agree. It's overall kind of sad.
At least he didn't use his intelligence for true evil.
are you still there?
It's been 10 minutes
What do you think of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman?
I do too
I was very impressed with both of them, what about Frozen?
I thought they actually did a very good job bringing the story to life in a different way
Yeah I couldn't agree more with you. 
Did you have any favorite parts? Characters?
Disney does a impressive job with animated movies. 
They really do. Its amazing how much detail they put into them.
Jonathan Gross as  Kristoff was my favorite character. 
how about yours?
Even though he didn't have a voice I liked Sven. I love how Disney always puts in non talking characters in their films that help move the story along
Yeah its impressive how they can give a character lots of personality without even having a voice.
I can only wish I was that talented as an artist. I am more the stick figure type of artist
Thats about as much talent as I have when it comes to art as well haha. 
My kids laugh at me all the time about it
From what I'm reading they created a Frozen Broadway show. That would be great to take your kids to!
Hello, are you there?
yes
is this the same person ive been talking to?
Are you still around?
yep still here
did you get the new document
I would be curious to see if htey come out with another frozen
usually sequels can be disappointing but that doesn't seem to be the case with animated movies. 
I think it could be really successful, especially as there has been a good break in time since the first one came out
It is interesting that Disney was able to add onto the history of works such as Beauty and the beast
Hello! Do you like superhero movies?
yes. batman begins! I think this a great batman film. have you seen it?
Yes, I have. Christian Bale is my favorite Batman so far.
Do you usually check the ratings of movies before you see them?
I usually do. but the rating dose not determine whether i will watch the movie or not
The film has several great big name actors, which is another reason I like this one and would watch it based on the actors alone
I agree, there are quite a few great actors in Batman Begins. I like Liam Neeson too, even though he is one of the villains.
seeing the potential for great actors together on a big screen defiantly gets my interest. along with super heros and villans.  a good  rating does help me feel like I will not waste my time watching something awful
but the same time will not deter me from a film If i am just into the genre
I personally prefer good ratings. Even if a movie has many good actors, if it's rated poorly, I usually won't watch it in theaters.
I'm not sure if I agree with the Metacritic Score of 70/100, though.
The 84% on Rotten Tomatoes seems more accurate.
I will generally have enough patience to wait for a film to be released on DVD/Video if the rating turn me off.
What did you think of the bat scene in the movie?
I felt that scene shows the story of this film well, and is thought out.
I wonder if there was a better place for the bats besides a dry well, though.
batman as a child was good step by the filmm aker to show how his life started out
Because this movie is called Batman Begins, I agree that it was appropriate to show Bruce's beginnings.
I think it's ironic that the mugger's name is Joe Chill, but he isn't  chill if he murders people.
unlikely yes, I think they were going for a mysterious beginning to show how batman came to be.  but still want to leave some mystery as he still develops a phobia to   the bats
very ironic. mr chill is more of a bone  chilling murderer. 
He is also murdered too, so at least he gets what he deserves.
he got whats coming to him. but  bruce dosent get to murder him so i think that leaves him wanting revenge 
I think it helps to establish that Bruce will not directly murder anyone. Even when he burns down the League of Shadows, he doesn't directly kill Ra's al Ghul.
Injustice should be not be used as a reason to murder, in any case.
I feel hes lucky become part of the league of shadows, and to purge his fear of bats. this key part I think is pretty lucky break for him. as he is doing jail time in a foreign country.
It is strange that his family could afford a butler but he goes to prison for stealing...
I really like Gary Oldman as Gordon. He plays a good cop really well.
What did you think of the Scarecrow scenes?
The scarecrow was particularly scary character. trying to poison the water supply
and batman was poisoned with the fear-inducing drugs, I thought it was over for him.
It appeared to be over for many characters in this movie at different points, yeah.
I was surprised when the real Ra's al Ghul showed himself, too. The League of Shadows doesn't die easily.
He seems to have otherworldy power after surviving his past experiences
hi
what moviie did you see
hello how are you? Have you heard of Batman Begins? It is a great movie!
no tell me more
what is it about
It stars Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Liam Neeson. Great cast right? 
yes
it is
what is the movie about
This is pretty much the reboot of the Batman film franchise with a new origin story. Christian Bale plays Batman. 
cool
how long is the movie
The film has pretty good reviews. Sorry but I am not sure how long the movie is based on the given document
oh ok.
what genre would you say the movie is
It is of course a superhero movie. T here are several DC comics characters in the movie like Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul.
thats great
I think I would love to see it
So in the beginning, Bruce Wayne falls into a well and is attacked by bats. 
then what happens
?
Well obviously he became afraid of bats. And then his parents get gunned down in the street by a mugger
is the movie an animation
No. It is not.
How does he become batman
The mugger is arrested for murder but soon freed in a plea deal. Bruce Wayne feels like he wants to take justice in  his own hands
cool
Is the movie in theaters
or on dvds
The movie is from 2005. So you can watch it on DVDs
Thats great
I would like to watch  it
Bruce Wayne travels around the world and finds League of Shadows
whats league of shadows?
League of Shadows is a secret organization with highly trained fighters 
where does bruce travel to?
All over the world. He finds League of Shadows in Bhutan. Meanwhile in Gotham, there is trouble brewing
:)
Is there any other main characters
Dr. Jonathan Crane, a corrupt psychiatrist, tries to transfer criminals to Arkham Asylum
You heard of Arkham Asylum? It is a criminal asylum for the insane
Good bye
Hello

gang leader threaten him
but michael really showed spirrit
Yes I totally agree 
You should watch it 
nice to talk
bye
Hey
Hi
Howâs it going?
Pretty good. Are you a Marvel fan?
Good to hear. Sure, what about you?
Yes, I am a huge Marvel fan. One of my favorites is the Avengers. Mark Ruffalo is great as The Hulk. 
Sure, I liked the Avengers a lot.
I also think Ruffalo is a great Hulk.
Is Avengers the movie weâre supposed to talk about?
Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 92% rating and average of 8/10. Yes, I believe so. 
Okay then. Right, Iâve always experiened that IMDB gives movies a lower average rating than rotten tomatoes.
Tha
That's true
But I guess 92 and 80 are a fair assesment.
Yeah, I think Joss Whedon was a good choice for director also. His vision was really inline with the comics. 
Well, I canât speak for the comics (havenât read them), but this movie is a great mashup of all the heroes and their stories.
I guess itâs just a very good movie with an amazing plot.
I agree. 
Loki using Clint Barton to help him with the Tesseract was awesome too. I like him even though he's a bad guy
Right, that was a great scene.
Lokiâs a likable villain Iâd say.
It was interesting how it caused such a riff within The Avengers. Thor still felt like he had loyalty to him for a long time during the movie. 
You think?
I thought he was pretty ruthless with him.
Thatâs just my opinion obviously.
I can see that somewhat but he could have done a lot more damage if he wanted to. 
Do you have a specific example on mind?
The end fight scene definitely was. He could have killed him. 
Oh, the one where Hulk ends up hitting him?
Yeah, that was classic. One of the funniest moments of the movie. I also liked when Iron Man fell back through the wormhole. It had everyone on edge I think. 
Absolutely. Epic scenes.
Can we talk about other movies or just this one?
You know, MCU
I also like the way Nick Fury stood his ground with the Council. Just this one. 
Understood.
Yeah, Furyâs great too.
So, any final thoughts?
It's crazy that the Council wanted him to drop a nuclear missile into New York. 
Great examples, man.
It was great talking to another MCU fan.
Take care now!
Definitely! You too!
Hi

No not gaslight 
Watch Gaslight! 
You too
I will!
:) 
Hi, how are you?
Good how about you
Have you ever seen jaws?
No I haven't. Is it good?
It is amazing. It's about a man trying to save his beach side town from a crazy shark
What about LA LA land? Have you seen that?
Would you say it has a happy ending to it?
I haven't seen LA LA land either. Which one would you recommend?
Yes. They kill the Shark and get to relax and be happy in the end
Aw man, spoilers haha
Honestly I would recommend jaws. It's such a great classic movie
Why not La La land? Do you not like it?
What genre is La La land? 
LA LA land is OK but it doesn't compare to the action of Jews. I give it a 7.8 whereas jaws is a 9.1
LA LA land is a musical romantic Comedy
Hmm, you might have to convince me a little more about Jaws just because I already know the ending. Since you said LA LA Land is a romantic comedy, is there any romance in Jaws?
And is LA LA Land based on a real story?
No. Jaws has little romance
Hi! So what did you think of the 1990 comedy Home Alone?
Hello. I like it. It's very interesting and hilarious to me seeing Joe Pesci in a movie like this since I know him form the more serious movies he did.
Very true! He nailed the role of Harry! All of the actors did! Was he your favorite actor in the film?
Macaulay Culkin is my favorite in the movie. It was so fun just watching him outsmart 2 grown men.
Agreed! He was my favorite as well! I can't help but agree with CinemaScore's rating of A as that would be the rating I'd give the film as well!
Yes this is a christmas classic and deserves an A rating. I feel the critic that described the movie as having an implausible plot is taking the movie more seriously than the creators of the movie intended it to be.
Very well said! Some of the critics were out of their minds. Especially the one you described as well as the one who called the first half "flat and unsurprising".
Yes I found the first half very entertaining. I haven't seen this movie in a little wow I might go back and watch it
I feel you! So hard to believe it was released in 1990! 
I like the quote "sadistic festival of adult-bashing". Between's Kevin's parents forgetting him and the burglars this movie doesn't make adult looks too bright.
That is true! Ha! Pesci and Stern did a great job acting the part as adults who weren't very bright! John Hughes wrote the movie perfectly!
I related to the character Kevin being made fun of  by his family since kids deal with that all the time. The part of the movie always always hits a soft spot for me.
Same here! I honestly felt bad for Kevin at first seeing as how he was ridiculed by his siblings/cousins before being left behind. Like you, i could relate as well to the ridicule aspect of it.
I wonder what kind of job Kevin's dad worked that he could afford to fly that many people to Paris for christmas. I blame him for all of this!
That is true! And plus they housed the entire family the night before their departure.
How much of rush do you have to be in to forget a whole human being. I guess nobody in the McCallister family was an early bird either. Alarms didn't always exist.
No kidding! I wonder that as well! Then they don't even realize he's missing until Kate discovered it during the middle of their flight. So awful!
I couldn't imagine anything other than my child being in danger convincing me to hitch hike with a polka band. I found that part very funny.
Same here - and in a moving van at that. That was incredibly hilarious!
Imagine going through the trouble of flying halfway across the world for a holiday and not even being able to enjoy your time on the trip. That wouldn't be good at all for me I would be so mad.
I know, right? At that point, I felt sorry for Kate as well. Then on top of that, you can only land a flight to Scranton and while there, all flights to Chicago were booked. Talk about stressful!
For sure very stressful. I wonder what the family was thinking back in Paris at the apartment of Kevin's Uncle.
Their vacation was certainly ruined while Kevin was in the process of rigging up their house with booby traps for Harry and Marv! That was a hilarious scene as well!
Kevin was a kid genius. Rigging up the house like mini macgyver. Of course seeing Marv and Harry get tricked was very funny. Thank god Marley got there before Kevin got hurt.
You're right! Thankfully he did get there just in time and the cops came shortly after to arrest Harry and Marv!
I love seeing the whole family reunited at the end. Having Kevin realize he didn't want his family to go away was very touching.
It was - especially after he sees the family was still gone on Christmas day at first before Kate entered the house calling for him.
I do find it a little interesting that no one informed the family about the events that took place while they were gone. I would figure the police might be interested to talk to Kevin's parents.
I agree but it was hilarious when Buzz yelled "Kevin what did you do to me room?" and Kevin ran off at the end. I enjoyed discussing Home Alone with you today!
Okay, have you heard of The Post?
Are you there?
Yes, sorry for the delay. I did see the movi e recently. I don't usually enjoy political films, but I thought it was quite well done.
No worries.  Oh, yeah, I thought Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks were both pretty good.
So, it apparently has a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 88%, which surprises me because, like you said, most people don't seem to go for political thrillers.
I think it has a lot to do with the cast, to be honest. Meryl and Tom and Sarah Paulson as well. If they didn't get those larger names, more people would have ignored it.
I'm looking to see who Sarah Paulson played. I saw it too...
Oh, she was Tony!
It's described as an American historical thriller, which I guess I agree with, given the nature of the Pentagon Papers.
I didn't realize it was directed by Steven Spielberg.
I feel like the struggle between the media and the people in power is always relevent
Yeah. It was interesting to see how the court case played out and how the newspapers sort of stood together.
Matthew Rhys was in it too...I like him as an actor.
Critics seemed to be torn about the movie..
One said, "The Post passes the trickiest tests of a historical drama...
Another said, "is too calculated to reflect today's ragged, tenuous sociopolitical climate."
Do you think you would see it again?
I I think seeing it a second time would be helpful to pick up the little things I might have missed. I'm not sure I would categorize it as calculated. It was intense, but I thought in a good way.
Who was your favorite actor in the movie?
Meryl Streep for sure. being the first female publisher  of a major news source, it was really amazing to see her part in the struggle and how it was unique to that role
Yeah there were some moments in the movie for sure.
I didn't realize the employee who leaked the papers had worked at the RAND corporation.
What did you think of Tom Hanks' performance in the movie? 
I thought it was really good. He does really well at things set more  in the past, like the 70s in this one.
I didn't really understand why the Rand employee had leaked the info in the first place. Did you catch that?
O r rather did you catch why? I feel like I must have missed something.
No, I think he was just disenchanted with the war and how we had escalated our involvement. 
Apparently Ellsberg overheard Robert McNamara saying he thought the war was hopeless, even though he was telling the public it was going well, and he became disillusioned about that and decided to leak the truth.
(It was YEARS LATER that he actually decided to leak the info)
That was a plot detail I definitely missed. Must have been an early scene in the movie.
Oh, you're right! I forgot that he had overheard that conversation. I'm glad Tom Hank's character was able to figure out it was he who had  leaked the info, and got all of the information he needed for the Post.
Yeah it was interesting how that developed. Do you remember how the legal issues developed? It says something about the paper's source being the same as the NYT's source. I had forgotten the NYT published something first.
Yeah having the same source put Graham possibly  in contempt of court.
Do you think Graham made the right choice to publish?
I'm a little torn, but, given the seriousness of the issue, yes. Normally I would tend to side with the government, but this was really mismanaged. It was an important decision for the court to side with the paper.
I just got another update...
Here is a question for you - would you recommend this movie to people you know (who haven't seen it)?
I would recommend it for sure to most people. despite it taking place int he 70's, I feel Spielberg took it in a really exciting direction instead of just throwing facts at you about the case.
I think it was filmed well, and I was surprised how much suspense built even though I already knew the basic facts.
There were so many details I had no idea about. And I like how it sort of set the stage for the Watergate scandal right afterwards with Nixon.
I completely forgot about that scene at the end! Just got some details for the movie summary, and it mentions that. I guess that was one year later.
What did you think of the part when the case  went to the Supreme Court?
Honestly, I really liked all of the scenes with Jesse Plemons as the lawyer. I thought he nailed it as far as lawyers taking a straight line even when something outside the box comes up. I wondered if the lines he spoke were based on facts and actual testimony.
It looks like we're all done here - thanks for chatting!
I don't remember much about the lawyer. I just liked how the other newspapers picke dup the mantle to support the Post and Times.
Oh yeah, thanks!
I really like the movie and how it covers the view from a villain's perspective.
I agree. I also liked the movie and really enjoyed that it was a family film.
The Minions provide an extra dose of humor too
Yes, they are a favorite among many people.
Do you like animated films?
Yes I do, especially since I have kids
Do you have kids?
I do, I did not realize that this was a debut film.  I assumed it was one of the more familiar animation company films.
Yes, it was the first film in the franchise from a few years ago
Is there going to be a new paragraph showing up?
Nevermind, there it is
It's funny to see a movie where two villians are against each other rather than a hero and a villian
I agree
It makes it almost more enjoyable since it is a new spin
It got pretty good reviews too
Exactly.  
The actor's performances and the minions contributed to the reviews greatly. 
A cast that everyone grew to love.
Yes, I didn't realize Russell Brand was in it
And I am not sure these directors have done anything else noteworthy?
Other than this movie series, I do not believe so.
Well I always have loved Steve Carell
yes, he is a funny actor
Although the future Minions movie wasn't as good
I have not seen that yet.  I remember the scene where Gru couldn't decide whether to go to the recital or steal the moon.
And he made the right decision at the end
It really made you feel good about the character
Right, even villians have a good side
My son thought the moon expanding with the ship was so funny
He kept saying that the shrinking would wear off 
He then thought Gru should try to help Vector off the moon 
Yea. Now I want to see the movie again!
Me too.  Watch it with my son again after all these years
see if he still gets a kick out of the movie since he's a teenager now
Yea The girls are great in it too
so all genders should enjoy it!
hello
i would love to watch this movie 
hello!
have you seen it?
Nope. But i want to. It seems very interesting and connects to most movies i have watched
so you are fan of these superhero movies as well?
yes i am 
i love the advangers movies
and the new wonder women 
Do you think Ben Affleck makes a good Batman?
I think he is a little on the odler side 
 but i still think he would be good for the part 
You will like him in this one for sure. 
sweet 
what are your thoughts about diana playing martha 
Nice little twist with the whole Kryptonite in this too
Yea I don't mind Martha at all. 
Yess!! Thats what i was thinking 
You don't like martha as a character? 
Yes I do 
Oh okay 
I do want to see this movie. Like i would like to see how the actors played the characters 
Batman rescued  here in this movie
hopefully this went all out with the acting 
 and graphics 
and just everything to be honest 
It's pretty good. It's about 153 mins long
Yes and i see it sasy that it is in between man of steel and dark night 
I liked the sneak peak of Wonder Woman in here too. 
She appears in it too?
Yes. 
It's pretty cool
That would be great 
I think Zack Snyder did a great job directing it 
I have seen a few of his moveis 
He killed it with this one 
 he does a great job with directing 
I agree with you 
Eisenberg played a good Lex Luther too 
Hello.
hello
Maleficent is a movie with great acting, Angelina Jolie plays the main character Maleficient
Oh good to know. Actually I haven't seen it before and I am trying to figure out if it is worth seeing.
If you start watching it, you will not want to stop.  The actors make it worthwhile.   You know it is based on the film Sleeping Beauty and is about the antagonist in that film.
Interesting. Is it appropriate for kids?
Its CinemaScore rating is an A.
Yes, my kids loved it
And where does the history take place?
It takes place when sleeping beauty is a little girl
And what happen with her?
What did you like most on it?
The best part is the story line.  It begins with Maleficient living in the Moors, which is a magical forest 
Maleficent falls in love with a human, but they fall apart.
Maleficent turns against the people, and protects the Moors.  When the kind tries to attack her she kills him and retreats. 
The king offered whoever killed Maleficent could marry her daughter.  Stefan cannot bring himself to kill her but instead cuts off her wings and presents them to the king. 
Maleficent turns the Moors into a dark kingdome.
It seems nice. It is a fairy tale though. And what about the other characters?
It is a fairy tale
Do you like fairy tales?
Yes for sure. Does it have lots of adventure?
The cast includes Angelina Jolie as Maleficent, Sarlto Copley as Stefan, Elle Fanning as Aurora, Sam Riley as Diaval, and Imelda Stunton as Knotgrass
Very interesting. Are the special effects nice?
Yes, very action packed.
The special effects are good, because the movie was just made in 2014
Maleficent raises a child who she dislikes, but grows very close to her as she raises her.
The girl is named Aurora, and she calls Maleficent her "fairy godmother"
Oh and the baby is Sleeping Beauty? That sounds interesting.
Yes, it is interesting
Are you familiar with the story of sleeping beauty?
Yes for sure. I like it.
So the ending of the movie is interesting, because Stefan locks his own daughter away.
Do you like movies that have a twist at the end?  Because this movie does
For sure I like. Don't tell me the end but is it surprising?
Yes, the end is surprising. The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.
Any other questions about the movie?
On you are almost convincing me to watch. Is there too much violence?
I am not sure about that, and I am not sure about the rating.  It was not too much for my kids, but it may be too much for yours depending on their ages.
Do you like watching movies with violence?
I like but not just because of the violence. It has to be some purpose. But in this case I am more concerned about the kids.
Thanks a lot for your talk. It was really nice.
Thanks
Hi there. What did you think of the movie?
Hello?
Hi, I think it's great, it would be good as a B roadway musical
Why do you think it would be great as a Broadway musical?
mainly the singing but also since the story is about a journey.
What do you think?
The music in movie is very catchy and enjoyable, so I agree.
Whose journey did you find most compelling?
Anna's journey
Did you think the conclusion was satisfying for her character?
She was trying to be herself and at the same time protect her sister so I think it was satisfying since that was accomplished.
I agree
Have you heard of the fairy tale that the movie was based on?
No, never.
Which character do you most admire?
hello?
the shape of water
hi!
hi
do you like romantic movies?
i'm not a big fan but i watch them sometimes.
what is this movie about?
this one is 2017 american fantasy drama
sounds interesting.
it is about a mute cleaner who works in a secret laboratory for the government
she falls in love with a strange creature
i like this type of stories
it has a great rating on Rottent tomatoes
sounds like something i'll like to see. tell me more...
the critical responses to it was awesome
i don't usually go for the critics choice... i like to make my one opinnion
do they end up together?
do you choose movies based on the cast?
sometimes
who's pla ying in this one?
well, sally hawkins was the main actres
i liked her in Paddington
I didn't watch this one
she's a good actress
but she is a good actress
is she the main character?
she is , she played the rule of elisa the mute cleaner
the movie was produced in 2017
do you want me to reveal a little spoiler
why not :)))
she kidnapped the creature and kept it in her bathtub
interesting
Hello!
hey, what's up
have you watched la la land before?
Yes. I really appreciated how much thought went into the movie's title. I think it's really cool how it refers to Los Angeles, music, and having your head in the clouds all at once. It's really spectacular how they summed up so many elements of the movie in such a short title
Have you seen it?
yep -  i watched it because critics seemed to like it
I agree with most of the critics in the paper
Yes. I especially agree with the review that La La Land is successful at showing the hardships that are involved with chasing a dream
I disagree with the two reviews that the film is dull and that the middle was boring. I really found the entire movie to be enthralling. 
yep, i agree with you - i do believe we have to cut emma stone and ryan gosling some slack, since they're not singers
Agreed. I really liked the scene where Sebastian improvs jazz music when he is supposed to be playing Christmas music only. 
It was one of those scenes that really stuck with me after I watched the movie
would you do that, if you were in his position?
I'm not sure. I liked how that was when Mia first heard Sebastian sing and was truly moved by it. I think it was interesting way to initiate their relationship
yeah, it was just sad how he brushed her off, since things could've been different
I do like how the next time Mia sees Sebastian he is also singing. I also liked how she kind of teased him by requesting a song she knew he would hate to sing
do you usually watch musicals?
Occasionally. I also enjoyed the development of Sebastian and Mia's relationship, such as when Mia decides to begin writing a play all by herself because Sebastian suggests it to her. I feel like the two of them really grow as individuals when they get into a relationship
I enjoyed that part too, since it also shows how hard both of them are working to achieve their dreams
they both want to become successful in their separate areas, but they have to struggle a lot
Right. I feel like the review that mentions the cruelty that's involved in following your dreams really sums it up. The film is not afraid to show how much hard work and hardship is involved in making it big
i also thought it was difficult for sebastian to take keith's offer
i mean, he gets paid, but it's not something he wants to do. This happens in life a lot
I agree. It must be hard to do something you're not passionate about- especially when it's something you must do in order to one day live out your dreams
What did you think of the scene when Mia and Sebastian get into a fight about Mia thinking Sebastian is giving up on his dreams?
it was definitely well acted, and i sympathize with both of them
but i think sebastian was harsh when he said that mia liked him more when he was unsuccessful
It truly was heartbreaking when Mia moved back home to Nevada
i feel he didn't want to hear the truth, because he was really giving up on his dreams
it really was sad
I agree. It was also a very unpredictable plot twist. I did not see it coming at all
would you say that was the low point in the movie?
Yes but I wouldn't say any part of the movie "sagged badly" as one review claims
i agree - overall, i would recommend the movie to a friend
I agree. As another review points out it was a "genuinely romantic comedy", which I completely agree with because I feel as though Sebastian and Mia's relationship was not as cliche as many love stories are in movies. I appreciated the realness of their relationship
yes, that was one thing i loved about the movie - while it was sad, it was not a cliche ending
I agree. I think Damien Chazelle really did a good job directing the film. 
i'm curious, are you an ai
if so, i was completely fooled
I am not! 
But I really was surprised that someone reviewed Sebastian as a "jazz snob" because I did not get that vibe at all
yeah, i disagreed with that characterization, but i can see why someone might say that.
he is a purist, or whatever they called it in the film
I also really didn't think Mia's character lacked depth. I think she was a rather round character, especially with the large amount of independence she possessed. It took a lot of courage for her to move back to Nevada
yes, i thought her character was pretty nuanced, but i'm not sure it being courageous of her to move back to Nevada. After the play didn't go well, I think that was her only option
*about it
I suppose you have a point. I just think she was more independent of the average woman portrayed in films as she didn't cling on to Sebastian when things didn't work out for her. 
although I wish they reconciled before achieving their dreams
the bit at the end that showed what could have been actually made me sad
I agree! It was very sad but also, as one reviewer puts it quite "bittersweet." I wasn't sure how to feel at the end. 
It was nice discussing the film with you! Have a great day!
you guys have a pretty good ai system
i was actually completely fooled
HI
Hey there.
HOW IS MOVIE
I don't know. I don't have the document with the movies name. What is the movie's title?
Do you have the document?
AVENGERS
CHARACTERS ARE VERY INTERESTINGS
YA I HAVE DOCUMENT
Oh cool! I really liked the first two movies. 
REALLY
Is it the same cast of characters? Iron Man? Thor? Black Widow? Captain America?
MISSING HULK NAME
Oh yeah! Forgot about the Hulk. Does it say what the movie is going to be about? Like the plot?
TONY STARK ACTING IS VERY AMAZING
I agree! Robert Downey Jr. is a good actor. 
What is this new Avengers movie about?
DO U LIKE HIM
I do.
ME ALSO
Does the document describe who the enemy is?
S 
WHO IS THAT PERSON
Who is the enemy in the movie?
ILOKI
LOKI
Ah I see! Thor's brother. Have you seen the first two films?
HE IS THE LEADER OF AN CHITAURI
When will the movie be released?
YA I SAW
2012
Did it receive good reviews?
U ALSO AH
Hi there, have you heard about the movie The Post, is by Spielberg
No, I haven't. Tell me about it?
It has Meryl Strep and Tom Hanks in it, it's about the first female publisher of the Washington Post and they were going to publish the Pentagon papers
Oh that sounds interesting! is it a thriller?
Political thriller, Rotten Tomatoes  users gave it a 88% approval rating
I really like Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks. 88% seems unusually low for Those actors.
Maybe but critics said it was an impeccably acted film, you should see it.
I would like to, maybe I'll check to see if it's available streaming online. tell me more about the drama.
The Post was apparently trying to release papers detailing they 30 year involvement of the US government int he Vietnam War
Oh I like things that portray stories about the Vietnam War. In fact I am going to see Maya Lin Speak next month about her work designing the war memorial.
Yep, well  a military analyst, Ellsberg is in Vietnam during combat and documents the activities for the secretary of defense but when he realizes that the secretary believes the US is going to win the war, he is disappointed because he doesn't agree. Years later he photocopies classified reports and releases them.
It sounds like it was a decision made out of spite. What did he gain from those actions I wonder?
And by then he was working as a private contractor for a company named Rand. He leaked them to the NTY
That's a pretty prestigious paper. Did they run the story right away?
it was a difficult decision to make
The guy that leaked the story, was that played by Tom Hanks?
Nope, Tom Hanks is an assistant editor a the post, he tracks down Ellsberg as the source of the leak
Who plays Ellsberg?
sorry, bob odenkirk plays the editor, Hanks plays a guy named Ben Bradlee, don't know who plays ellsberg. The post was having a hard time deciding whether to publish or not, the nixon administration brought charges against them
Oh it sounds really involved, that whole scandal is so interesting. Don't you just love historical dramas?
Yes, the editor Katharine Graham knew that she had to decide whether to publish or not, if she did, she could be charged with contempt of the court and if she published, she would establish the washington post as a very importan journalistic institution
she was the heir of the newspaper so she considered it a family legacy
Gosh, that seems like history never changes. Government always trying to silence the press.
Exactly! The White House retaliated and ordered the post and the NYT to appear before the supreme court to pled their first amendment to publish the story
Good for them! 
the supreme court ruled 6-3 in favor of the newspapers, which vindicated Graham's decision.
now I really want to see it. It sounds really juicy, but it will be a little difficult because I feel like the situation will anger me.
But they won. Nixon god mad and barred The post from the White house
sorry, got mad
Typical, sounds like another president.
ha ha, critics said movie shows that "history repeats itself"
HI
Hey there.
HOW IS MOVIE
I don't know. I don't have the document with the movies name. What is the movie's title?

Did it receive good reviews?
U ALSO AH
Hi there! Ready to chat?
Hi
Yes
Alright. So the movie I have is the original Iron Man. It came out in 2008. Have you seen it?
So whatâs the movie 
I actually have but itâs been awhile 
So tell me about it
Cool. It has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 94, a MetaCritic score of 79, and a CinemaScore of A, all of which I agree with. I thought it was a pretty good movie. What about you?
I thought it was good too
I like Robert Downey jr as iron man
Yeah, same here. I feel like he did a great job being an eccentric, rich businessman-turned-superhero.  
Terrence Howard was also in it as James Rhodes, along with Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, the primary antagonist. Gwyneth Paltrow was also Pepper Potts.
Yeah I liked it what was the plot of the first one
I get them mixed up
I actually forgot about this until just now, but the intro is set in Afghanistan, with Tony being captured by a terrorist group.
I like Terrance Howard as well
I actually don't know too much about Terrance.
He plays on empire he was in hustle in flow
Ah, I see. Haven't seen either of those.
And some other good movies
But anyway back to the topic at hand
Some of the critical responses to Iron Man were: "impressive sets and mechanics that combine smoothly with relatively seamless CG"
What happens in this movie 
I remember the CG being pretty decent for a 2009 movie.
I'd love to tell you but I don't have the page with the plot summary anymore, haha. :)
Yeah Iâm having a hard time remember which one was which
Oh well thatâs no good
Well what do you know
Oh okay, here we go. It just gave them back to me. Basically he's giving a defense contract demonstration, and is captured and wounded. A fellow-scientist is also captured and creates a device that keeps the metal shards in his chest from going in any deeper.
Yeah I remember a little about that
Tony escapes by building a metal suit out of scrap while also pretending to build a missile for the terrorist group. The metal suit is his prototypical Iron Man suit.
Itâs hard to believe this movie is 10 years old already 
I know. Time goes so quickly in the entertainment industry. :P
Conversation's up for me. Have a great day!
Batman vs Superman
The director is Zack Snyder, 27% Rotten Tomatoes, 4.9/10.
Not very popular it seems
But the audiences liked it. It has a B cinema  score 
Yes
There is a huge divergence between proffession al critical opinion and regular movie goers
I've never seen it
I know the difference. 
I can't believe they used Ben Affleck as Batman
So it probably won't get any awards, but should have done well enough at the box office
It was a strange choice
Well it was made in 2016
I'm just guessing as to what it may have accomplished back then
Probably nothing with those scores
The box office  gross is more important than critics acceptance for these blockbuster type movies
I don't like how they made a whole new story line.
They ruined it for me
although critics can affect word of mouth to an extent
Batman as a billionaire
yeah right!
Isn't that what he always was?
But they make it the main focus.
Batman I know, was humble
The lack of intellectual development for the main characters was my problem. Especially concerning Lex Luthor
Have you seen this movie?
Yes I have
What was your favorite part?
Lex L uthor was the worse villain ever
You think?
This wasn't a memorable movie. It got me through a bucket of popcorn at the moment I was watching, but you forget about it soon after
hahaha
Did people know that they were super heroes? 
The best part was Wonder Woman action scenes  in the final act
I love Wonder Woman
Wonder Woman is the right name for her cause I always wonder why they took so long to get her into the movies
haha
I agree!!!!
I agree do you like action movies?
I like some action movies, yes.  Do you?
yea I enjoy most
John Wick is really good
Agreed.  I liked both of them. You?
same
Did you like one more than the other?
both about the same
Will you see the next one?
yea
What other movies do you like?
Do you like fast and the furious movies?
Are you still there?
Hello?
Hello
Hi
What is the name of the movie?
Batman v Superman. Have you watched it ?
No, I havent, is it good?
Are you still there?
It's better than Man of Steel, the superman movie
But well below Dark Knight.
Hello. 
Hi there.
Have you ever seen this
Yes
I never saw it, Iâm not really into that type of movie
What type do you prefer
Comedy
Eh I'm not a fan
This movie has some great actors 
Haha. It's animated!
Oh I just saw that!
Yeah, they're voice actors.
Still good tho
I think I tried watching this with my son before
And he didn't like it?
No I believe he did
Ah nice
I don't have kids
I just wasnât paying much attention to it
Yeah it's more of a kids' movie
Nice of you to watch with him though!
Is it 3-d
Yes
Oh..that might be interesting to see in theater
I honestly just go for the popcorn haha
Maybe I will try to watch it again with him
Sure give it a shot
Why not?
Me too! I love the popcorn!
My waistline doesn't ;)
The plots sounds good and it got pretty ok reviews
Yeah good rotten tomatoes score
Itâs the butter for me!
Hello?
hi
hi
so i heard you seen a movie?
yes, Despicable me. It's an animated movie that came out a few yers ago
nice that's sound interested. can you tell me a little bit about it?
would an adult also enjoy the movie?
Sure, it stars Steve Carrell as a supervillan, with Russell Brand as his scientist/partner in crime. It was directed by Pierre Coffin..
awesome
do they offer a 3d version as well?
yes! It got a rotten tomato score of 81%, and most reviews praise how smart the humor is. It's good for the whole family.
Yes, it comes in 3d and regular 
nice
Do you want to know the plot?
i like steve carrell, he was funny in other movies i have seen him in as well. i think it would be funny to see him doing a animated voice over.
no please tell me a little bit about it
yes i mean lol
it really is! It is designed very well, and his personality comes through in the animation. Steve Carrell is trying to steal the moon after another villan steals the Pyramid at Giza
oh wow that sound interesting. what age group  would you see this movie is made for?
I would say it's for young kids all the way up to adults. It is a good blend of silly and intelligent humor
is there alot of singing in the movie? i dont particular like musical type movies but my kids do?
there's a song written just for this movie by Pharell. It's not too much music, and it's probably too hard for kids to memorize & sing constantly, but there are characters called Minions that dance and act very silly
oh ok. lol sounds like my kind of movie. I'm a big kid at heart
is the movie pretty long or standard?
me too, I really enjoyed it. It's a good mix of funny and feel-good, Gru eventually adopts three little girls who help him steal the moon. It is not too long, maybe 1.5 hours
oh that is not bad at all. i think i will look forward to seeing this movie with my kids. should keep their attention for awhile. lol
lol it definitely will! although they might just want to watch it over and over again
cool, this definitely helped me out . oh hey is this a disney movie or who is it made by?
It's made by a French studio Mac Guff, but Illumination Entertainment bought the studio and released this movie with Universal Pictures.
oh wow i didn't know universal had their hands in animation. 
i didn't either, I think maybe they're involved because it was a Computer Animated film
oh. makes sense
will you watch it with your children or let them watch it while you do other things?
i thiink i would like to watch it with them. Sounds like it may be fun for the whole family.
Hello
do you see the movie info?
time to abort
hi
What did you think of Gal Gadots portrayal of Wonder Woman? 
I thought she did a great job.
What did you thinK?
I agree! Loved it. 
I thought she was a great choice.
Me too!
She was unknown to me before.
Do you know if she was in anything before Wonder Woman?
So, what else did you like?
Hello there
What's the name of the movie?
Hi there!  The movie we're talking about is Home Alone.
Alright. What's it about?
It's about a boy who is left behind when his family goes on vacation.  Some robbers try to break in and he has to deal with them.
Oh no Poor kid
Is this movie entertaining to both kids and adults
It doesn't seem like a very good movie, the scores are all pretty low and the critics have a lot of negative things to say about it.
Huh interesting
Did they say why they didn't like it?
They said it was kind of flat and sort of gimmicky.  Some of the humor is supposed to be good though.
I see. What does the kid do when the burglars break in?
One of the critics says that there are a bunch of sadistic booby traps that seem kind of implausible.
Hmm sadistic booby traps. 
What is the kids name?
His name is Kevin, and apparently the kid gets left behind because the family overslept on the day of their flight and had to rush to the airport.
I wonder how any family forgets one of their kids haha. 
Do they realize they forgot him?
Well there was a power outage that reset all the clocks, so that made them have to rush and not notice he was missing.
How many kids do they have?
Well there's Kevin, the youngest, and his older brother Buzz, who he gets in a fight with.
Does Kevin reunite with his family eventually?
I'm not sure.  The mom finds out he's missing on the plane to Paris, and then has to fly back part of the way and then hitchhike back home.
Does Kevin get rid of the robbers eventually?
I'm not sure, I just know that Kevin's traps for them are pretty nasty.  One of the critics said it was a "Festival of adult bashing".
Does it mention anything about the amount of money the movie made?
Nope, but it only has a 62% on rotten tomatoes so I would assume it didn't do very well.
Does it mention if there are any sequels made?
I don't see anything about a sequel. The movie came out in 1990 so it's pretty old now.
What actors are a part of the cast?
The cast is Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, John Heard, and Roberts Blossom.
Those are some good actors
Which ones play the robbers?
The robbers are Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, and their character names are Harry and Marv.
hello!
i hope you like romance, because ive got a scorcher here
the 2004 ryan gosling drama: the notebook
Yeah I like romance
well you're in for it, this ones based on a best seller
well then!
ready when you are
Have you seen the new Wonder Woman movie with Gal Gadot. It's got a pretty high Rotten Tomatoes score, 96%?
Wow that is a good score. Who plays the main character?
I haven't seen it by the way.
Is Gal Gadot the main character?
Gal Gadot. I haven't seen her in anything before, but apparently she's "an inspired choice".
To play Diana.
Is the movie action packed?
Do you know any of the supporting characters' names?
Quite so. It's set during World War I and is describes as not demurring from depicting from war time violence
Whats its rating as far as kids go?
Is it PG-13?
I'm not sure. You should check that out online for sure. It seems like a pretty good movie for a tomboy. Did you know the movie is directed by a woman? Patty Jenkin's the first woman to direct a live action theatrical movie.
How did it do at the box office?
I'm not sure. But based on the high scores, I'm sure it did well.
And my fave guy, Chris Pine co-stars. He plays a pilot, how dreamy.
he is dreamy. any other big stars?
Robin Wright plays Antiope, her sister. 
has she won any awards recently?
I don't really pay attention to award shows, so that's not something I would know. I love Robin Wright though, I hope they include her in other Marvel Movies. I think she would have actually been a good Wonder Woman. 
are there other marvel characters in the movie?
Nope, but I do get Chris Pine confused for another Marvel Character though.
One of my favorite movies of all time
Mine too! I still get nervous going into the ocean
So do I! It freaks me out, big time
I know.I think this was one of Speilbergs best films.
Most definitely 
I love all of them, so I can't say that I have a favorite
I love Richard Dreyfus and his Matt Hooper was fabulous. Did he get nominated or win an Oscar for that role?
I'm not sure. If he didn't, he sure deserved it
I find it interesting that Metacritics only had a score of 87/100 for Jaws. What were they using to measure this? Rotten Tomatoes gave it 97%
I know, I don't get that either since it was the best in it's time and still is today, in my opinion.
Agreed. I still like watching it when its on TV. I've been known to download it for a long flight too. The cast was outstanding and the music!!! Still gets me creeped out.
Same here! My wife hates those movies and don't like to see them.
I don't know how she can hate it, but it's my favorite
I saw that the critics found it funny, in a weird sort of way. I think I kind of agree with that comment. There are moments that are funny, I can't say I agree with your wife, but it did scare some people too much. Maybe it scares her and thats why she hates it.
I kind of enjoyed the scary moments in it
It's so realistic and it could happen.
It does happen more than you think
It has happened! Thats whats so scary. Several attacks likek that off the east coast last summer.Felt like I was living Jaws! I stayed off the beach last summer!
So did I, it freaked me out too much
In the film the found a tiger shark so they thought the beach was safe. Kind of like when we see a dolphin fin, scream, and then realize it was ok.The next day they see a great white in the same area of the beach. Jaws for real.
I know, one reason why I try and stay out of the oceans
I know theres an alligator hunter that finds and removes those guys. In the movie they paid Quint, Richard Dreyfus to find the shark. Who would do that in real life? Not me!
10K or not, I would not get in that water or that boat if a great white were out there
No way, I wouldn't either
Nope not at all
sounds like you're pretty clever! Ironic they named the boat the Orca in the movie. Those Orcas are supposed to be pretty safe.
Yeah, you know when you hear the music, look out
And can you imagine what it was like getting in a shark proof cage? I know someone who did that once. They said they'd never do it again!
No way! I would have a heart attack
Well, at least Jaws had a happy ending. Not for the shark though. The good old days when they made you feel good before you left the movie!
Hi are you ready to get started? This is a batman vs superman superhero crossover movie. Are you familiar with those superheroes?
We are here to discuss Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice
Yes i am familar with the characters but some of the actors i have never heard of
I think it sounds like an amazing movie. I love superheroes. I think some of the critics are too harsh. It was a good plot line. I am familiar with Ben Affleck but none of the others. 
I wish they would have used more famous people. 
I would agree though that it was not as good as man of steel. The plot line of that was amazing!
Ben Affleck is the only actor I recognize great plot very harsh critcs
I agree. I didn't completely understand why Batman and Superman fought though. 
Rotten Tomatoes list it as 27%and average with a 4.9 out of 10. The critcs must be weird. Yeah i couldnt figure out the fight but think it was because superman accidentally killed bruce waynes dad
I thought it was worth a meteoritic score more than 44. That seemed low! That makes sense. I would be mad if someone tried to kill one of my family members. 
hello?
Yeah me to it did also have a unique spin on character of Lex Luthor who just seems to go doown hill the whole movie. I like how the critic talked about Lex (who is supermans arch enemy ) because he compared him to the joker and riddler (who are batmans arch enemies
Then he tops off the crazy part by comparing him to Mark Zuckerburg. 
Ohh. I liked that too. I like how they always try to biring in the government official s
Yeah im still here just slow typer
Do you like batman or superman better in the movie?
Actually superman 
How bout u
I grew up watching the justice league cartoons in thelate 70s and early 80s in which alll the superheros worked together.
I love batman
He is so mysterious 
Sorta ironic that they become enemies 
Yes he is very mysterious
It is. Its not what I expected at all
I expected more like the avengers where a bunch of heroes work together 
I don't really like that they are enimies
Especially to the point where batman was going to kill superman 
Me either but superman pretty much started it the article says clark kent was trying to make bruce wayne and batman look bad thru his news articles
You know though to be honest if you look at the way the world is today so full of bad it makesperfect sense in a world view to have them as enemies. 
I guess so. They do have polar opposite personalities. One is a humble farm boy and the other is a rich executive 
I could see why they clash in that aspect, but I guess I don't imagine them interacting very much in superhero world. 
It says in the 3rd part that at supermans funeral that bruce way e apol9gizes to lois lane saying that he failed superman
DUUHHHH well yeah he failed him if he killed him lol
I would feel like if I failed someone if I let them die too. Haha. I like the mysterious dirt levitating though 
Haha 
Thats what I was thinking 
Little humor there
Have u seen this movie 
No have you? is that the end?
I can't tell
Oh yeah. It is.
I wonder if there will be a sequel 
Yes watched it 3 times its a tearjerker for me when superman dies
I feel like good superhero movies need sequels 
I dunno could be a sequel 
Like how superman didnt really die he just hibernated til he found out a way to smooth it over with batman
Is your document about the movie "The Social Network?"
Yes it's about The social Network
Cool, so we're on the same document.  You know it's got a score of 96% on Rotten Tomatos.  It's pretty darn good.
Yeah the rating is pretty good. Do you check the rating of a movie before you watch it?
I usually do.  I normally check the Metacritic Score.  Since this one was 95/100 I figured it would be pretty good.  Did you know that Amie Hammer played two roles?
I never noticed. Must be a very good actor.
Well, if you look at the document, he played both Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.
Do you think Mark Zuckerberg really behaved like the actor in the movie?
Jesse Eisenberg did a good job of playing the brilliant hero, Founder Mark Zuckerberg.  I thought it was exciting and instinctivly perceptive.
I think Justine Timberlake should stick to singing. I didn't buy his role for one second. Did you?
You know the character of Mark Zuckerberg was only 19 and he basically started Facebook after being dumped by his girlfriend.
Yeah. That was a really shallow move by Mark. Though I bet she regrets it now.
Regret is speculative.  The movie's main source was a book called "The Accidental Billionaires" which was was a contentious book that may or may not be believed.  
Do you agree with the CinemaScore Rating?
Yes. I totally agree on the rating. It really was a good movie
You know the whole Facebook Experiment started out as a way to increase the dating pool for Harvard students.
Yeah i can see that. Do you think it worked?
I don't think people from Harvard have trouble getting dates.  Do you remember who Andrew Garfield played?
I really don't. I was surprised to find out how the name facebook came about. Do you think Christy Lee brags about it?
Perhaps.  I found it interesting that before Facebook, it was called "The Facebook."  Do you remember the co-founder of Napster?
Yes. He actually made them drop "The" from the name to become just Facebook.
Do you remember where they moved to in California when they started the company?
I believe they used the house as the company headquarters.
Do you remember how much academic probation Ma rk Zuckerberg got?
Yes. I hear silicon valley has one of the higest rates in rent
yeah I think it was 6 months probation? correct me if I am wrong
Yes, it was 6 months of Academic probation.  I enjoyed how the narrative was inter cut with scenes from the deposition,  What did you like?
I liked the whole court process. I think everyone came out a winner
I agree.  Everybody got rich.  Do you remember that last scene when Zuckerberg kept refreshing his old girlfriend's page?  I liked that.  What scene did you like?
I particularly liked the scene where Zuckerberg hacks into the different college database to steal photos because it portrayed computer programming accurately. 
That was lame of him. But we all have our days
Have you seen the original Toy Story?
I have seen all three Toy Story movies.
Have you seen the original?
Yes.  I can't believe the first one came out in 1995!  
It has been a while, but they are all decent.  Toy Story 3 is, in my opinion, the best.
You should watch it again sometime. The Potato shaped doll is voiced by Don Rickles.
I know.  He has recently passed.  He was Mr. Potato Head.
Do you have a favorite character. 
Tom Hanks as Woody actually makes to the doll, Woody believable as a character.
I think Tom Hanks was wonderful.  Although I think Tim Allen deserves a lot of credit as well.
Where do you rank the movie among Pixar movies?
Did you know that Joss Whedon and Joel Cohen wrote some of the screenplay?
I did not know that.  Joss Whedon is good.  I don't know Joel Cohen.  I was a big Buffy fan.
According to critics it is one of the best animated movies in recent memory with all these actors.
Yes, but what do you think about it?  Is it one of your favorites?
On rotten tomatoes it has a 100% fresh rating and Cinema Score gave it an A.  I would say that means it's pretty good.
I understand, but did you watch it and form your own opinion.  I mean 100% just means a lot of critics liked it more than disliked it.  It doesn't mean critics thought it was one of the best of all time, you know.
Need a human for that.
One of the best scenes is when Buzz is first introduced to the characters. It's pretty funny that he thinks he's an actual space ranger.
I enjoy that scene as well.  
Do you think it's the best Pixar movie of all time?
It must be the highest rated.
I wouldn't be surprised if Toy Story 3 is ranked higher, but I haven't checked.
Which is your favorite character in the movie?
Slinky dog or Rex
There is a morality tale including in a seemingly simple story when it comes to the relationship between Buzz and Woody. Woody feels replaced and when he knocks Buzz out the window everyone thinks he is jealous for that reason.
Disney world is going to make a roller coaster out of Slinky Dog.  Do you think that will be great?
I don't know if I'd call that a morality story, but go on.
Interesting. They should make one for Sid's dog, Scud too.
That might work.  We're looking forward to Toy Story World.
Anything else strike you as important about the movie?
I have not heard of TOy story world.
The end is funny when Andy's newest gift worries the toys.
It's the world disney world is making in Hollywood Studios.  Disneyworld is divided into four parks, which are further divided into lands
Toy Story Land is an upcoming world.  (Also star wars world).   Have a wonderful night.
I see.
You too!
Hi. Can you tell me the name of the movie?
It's Mean Girls.
Have you seen it?
No I have not. Is it about girls?
Yes. And those girls are mean
It's a 2004 film that is an American teen comedy film written by Tina Fey
Do you know the rating of the movie?
What I know is that Rotten Tomatoes named it in its "Top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies".
So it was received pretty well.
Is it something you could take a child to see?
I guess it depends on your style of parenting and how old they are. The movie does have sexual references and (I think) cursing. 
But that's to be expected in a teen comedy film.
Do you know if it won any major awards?
It was praised as being "comic gold".
That sounds pretty good. Do you know if Tina Fey has written any other movies?
I'm not sure but she has been highly praised for this film. Lindsay Lohan as Cady Heron was the main character.
I don't want to get bored. Do you know how long the movie is?
The movie is pretty long but just a normal length.
Hi! I've really enjoyed the movie "Real Steel" It was a great movie that was full of adventure!
I've seen this one before
seems kinda like a typical family-action film with some scifi elements
was kinda cool tho
Yes it is sort of the family type of film. But I got very much into the characters especially Hugh Jackman's.
was interesting to see Hugh play a more domestic role 
normally he's always a loner fighter type
Yes but  he played it well and was able to pull it off.
yeah he played the struggle of the character well
I always find it interesting to see what sort of demands actors can get into. I think he fit in with everyone else really well.
yeah the unusual mix of actors led to a coherent mixture 
That's definitley true.
I enjoyed seeing all of the different robot fighters in the movie s well.
the new paragraph loaded reminds me of how interesting the factor that these robots were an everyday thing in the movie's world
like he's just a lower-class dude but he owns a fighting robot
Yeah seeing the draw of their world and how these robots are just sort of common was something that I really liked as well.
I thought about what it would be like to really live in that world
also interesting how it brings up the point that improved technology doesn't make all problems go away
this guy still is in debt and so on
Yes no matter what we have basic life issues will never really change. They'll just come about in a new way.
that was a pretty good scene (the new paragraph)
kind of hinted at things remaining worse for the guy/son but eventually they fought their way back
cool to see the human spirit reflected in robots
Oh yeah lol I remember that...
It's just the classic underdog story told in a somewhat different way. There will always be trials and triumphs
As long as humans are around we'll never really intrinsically change .
yeah the robots don't change the human life, they just augment it
nothing intrinsic is lost
Right. I suppose in many ways we were really supposed to see the robots as humans - more so than the actual humans. That's a really  interesting concept, I think.
kinda reminds me of virtual reality
humanity lives on but through the robots
even though the robots are doing the action their action is still fully human
Yeah that's very true. I would love it if someday we could really have virtual reality like that. It would be so much fun to be able to really feel like you're a super hero!
yeah, you'd have the thrill of a suernatural existence without losing your humanity
i think that's a nice message the film has
Right that is very true. We're all interconnected in this world somehow. Even if some people do have  more than others.
HI there! Have you ever seen this?
Hey! Yeah I have but it was a LONG time ago
what about you
It was a long time ago for me too, but I remember because all the dark knight movies came out afterwards
though they took forever to make those ones... or at least waited forever
I personally liked the dark knight movies way more
especially the first one
yeah, they didnt do a very good job of connecting the storylines
and christian bale wasnt my fav batman either
i don't think too many people like him as batman honestly
The voice he made was almost comical
the best part is he tried so hard on that voice too
hahaha I know
but i cant talk too much because i always get flack for like ben affleck
liking*
affleck>bale 
YAS someone agrees haha
what about tom hardy in the new ones?
I'd say he did better than both of them 
I agree!!!!
its been years but i still can't get over heath ledgers acting as the joker 
that was some next level stuff
Agreed. It took a lot of good ating to be as good in the role as jack nicholson
oh jeez my typing is awful today. acting*
lol you're fine
im not used to typing without emojis 
oh yeah me too. too much texting
you know who i did love in these movies tho?
who?
MICHAEL CAINE
TRUEEEEEE
He does so well as alfred :'D
you can't not like him
mhmm. good in children of men too
Didn't he have a cameo in one of the recent superhero movies?
Or am i thinking of someone else/
michael caine?
yea
oh god there are so many superhero movies now that i really couldnt tell you
good point lmao
u wanna know one superhero movie that im REALLY excited for
whats that
THE INCREDIBLES 2!!!
k I just talked about this yesterday
I've waited for soooooo loooooong
i am so excited and its taking way too long
yes!
i will push children out of the way to watch it
right at the end of the movie, we were like when is the next...ten years later...haha
hahahaha
I think we are allowed to end our convo now?
I have no idea honestly
Haha well Im gonna see, it was lovely chatting!!! have a great day!
What's the name of the movie
Hi, the rotten tomatoes score is great but the meta critic score seems a little low a movie of this quality. 
Do you think you will like the movie
What kind of movie is it
when was the movie made?
Wonder woman, I think i would enjoy this movie very much
Whats the name of the movie
It is a action movie set in the DC comic world
Who stars in the movie
the movie was made in 2015
did it do well in theaters?
did I have to see other movies to get it?
The main character is Gal Gadot, but also stars  Chris Pine, Robin Wright and Danny Huston
what is the movie about?
No i think this movie is a stand alone piece that you wont need knoledge of other movies to understand it
It is a war movie action movie
Do you think this is a family movie for the kids
Are you familiar with any of the actors in the movie?
some of them
I think its acceptable for a family to watch with children
even though its about war
what kind of color pallet   does it tend to use
Yes they don't depict much of the war in the movie its more of theme then actually seeing the war
so is it dark and cold or bright and action
The movie tries to stop the war not be in it
how can one person stop a war
I believe the movie is a little bit of both. Bright for some scenes but dark for when things get gritty
Well shes wonderwoman she has super powers
so is it like a marvle movie
Yes except its in The DC universe instead of Marvle 
is it still out in theaters?
I dont think so im pretty sure its out on Blu ray now
John Wick is a good action movie, do you agree?
hey there\
yes i am agree
i love action movies
Me too.
There were some Russian mobsters in the movie.
He came out of retirement when his wife got killed.
yes 
The critics gave it a 86% score.  That's pretty good for an action movie.
That was rotten tomatoes.  Metacritic gave it a 68/100
yeah i saw that
i watched movies with better score
It said his wife died but gave him the puppy.  So his vengeance was for the theft of his car and the death of his puppy.
yeah but it was not a logical story
nobody have a vengeance for their puppy got killed
do you watch the climax
It is what they call neo-noir.  I guess that means it is not supposed to make sense because it is an altered reality.
Yes I watched the whole movie.
i watched some scenes
The idea was that he was a hit man who retired so he could hand out with his wife.
but now whole movie
oh that's nice
Sorry hang out.
a retired hit man
So his wife got the puppy and then she died of natural causes or di sease or something.
so that's movie with lots of action
oh that's too bad
so he find he whoever did that
She got him the puppy, then after she died they killed his puppy and stole his car.
Yes  that's what the movie is about.  The Russian mobster's son did it.
so what will happen in climax?
So he just went to kill that guy and in order to do it he had to go through a lot of Russian mobsters.
Let me check if they have that info.
sorry i didn't watch the whole film
At the end he was able to go to Iosef's safe house and kill him.
oh interesting
k bro lets finish the chat
He also killed the dad because the dad was mad that his son died and tried to kill him.
thank you for your valuable time to chat with me
good bye
Ok you think we have enough then.
Ok.
ok bro
shall we continue?
do you like we can
Yeah I have fifteen thanks.
Hello
Hello. How are you?
I'm good. Did you enjoy the movie?
Yes, I love musicals, and you? 
I think they are tolerable, but this one was pretty good.
I like that it was located in LA and made it pretty relatable.
Do you live in L.A.?
Vegas
Oh very cool. I'm in the South
Are you a Gosling's fan?
Emma Stone fan?
I really like them both. Which is your favorite?
Both are good actors, Goslings more attractive. HA!
What did you think of the filmâs perspective on success and satisfaction? 
I think I lost you somewhere in the conversation. Since it has been 5 minutes without a response from you, I am going to abandon the discussion. 
Have a great day
Thanks for the conversation

Hi
Hi there, what were you opinions?
I have one great movie to recommend 
Lay it on me, buddy
Did you watch The Great Gatsby
The adaptation starring Leonardo DiCaprio? I did indeed, it was enrapturing!
It is based on novel from 1925
Leonardo did some stunning acting 
Written by F Scott Fitzgerald? Indeed, truly the great American novel
I think this movie was the best in 2013 
great production and the vintage costumes were magnificent  
Without a doubt in my mind, Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway was a casting masterstroke in my mind
The costume design definitely invoked the nouveau riche ideals which were central themes in the source material
this movie entered the Classics 
Not only that, but Baz Lurhmann's direction was a magnificent sight to behold
Baz Luhrmann put a lot of drama and tension moments and combine it with romance   
Indeed, I also seem to remember the film picking up a wide amount of critical acclaim, and several award nominations for the efforts behind it
yes it was very strange that R.T gave only 48% rating
Perhaps, but I also seem to remember some of the more positive responses to the film, responses more in line with my own.
And the budget was 190 mil. $
I can definitely see where the money was placed, and for me it was all money well spent, as Baz Lurhmann seemed to have such a clear idea of the kind of film he wanted to craft.
Emily Foreman as Pammy  did very good job i li ke it very much
Absolutely, another character that Fitzgerald managed to make leap of the page, doing much the same in the film version.
Did you liked the car,the white limousine 
Absolutely, a style icon of the 1920s brought to life with startling vivacity, just one of the many set dressings that this film got entirely correct.
It was filmed in Australia 
Production started 2011
I think 2 years was time well spent to craft such a rich and vivid film, absolutely awe-inspiring!
yes indeed 
and a lot of champagne ,and classy moves   
Did you left ?
No, still here, just contemplating the character of Gatsby
New York in that time was amazing city ,full with class 
Indeed, but perhaps Gatsby himself reminds us that shallow shows of wealth are no compensation for human misery
Its interesting how such a richly written character can also work as an allegory in that way
I think finish button is open ,we can now finish the conversation .Bye
hello, are you familiar with how to do this task?
YES
I've done a few
okay. i have yet to do one. trying to figure this out
Just discuss the content, make statements etc about whhat we see now, then when the new paragraph gets added talk about that, supposedly it refreshes after we exchange X amount of messages.
Well it has Leo DiCaprio in it so it's probably good lol.  
YEah, tom hardy as Eames is prolly really different. I always remember him from batman
Cool concept with them having to infiltrate a persons subconscious.  
I agree, his character seems similar to the one he played in catch me if you can
yes indeed
It's really interesting that ellen page is recruited to construct dreamscapes
got a pretty good rating
Taking someone into a shared dream, not that's a cool concept.  
yeah, 86 percent. i like most cristopher nolan movies. especially batman
yes he is quite talented.  
yeah, it really is. i have liked almost all of nolans movies.
Very unique story line they have here.  Scene No.1 really sets the stage andbuilds interest
yeah, being attacked by projections seems neat
Dream sharing technology...  fifty years in a dream.  wow
yeah, shifting realities are so fascinating  
for sure
sending into limbo, not quite grasping that in the scene paragraph
multi level dreams also, different dimensions. all seem like they could happen
yeah you are right
sucks they framed cobb for her death in scene 2
Yeah, makes it interesting though
At least he made peace with it (Cobb)
yeah, facing a murder charge, woah
why do you think he joins his children in the garden?
not sure
any ideas?
try to escape the dreams, prove he is in the real world to himself
oh yes
of course
crazy they all awake on the plane. sounds like such a neat movie
Must see
yeah, science is a great genre. especially ones with these kinds of scenes and depth
Had to use a spinning top to figure out reality vs dream
yeah, such a cool concept
probably will watch it tonight now lol
me also. i cant really remember it
Hello! Do you like superhero movies?
yes. batman begins! I think this a great batman film. have you seen it?
Yes, I have. Christian Bale is my favorite Batman so far.
Do you usually check the ratings of movies before you see them?
I usually do. but the rating dose not determine whether i will watch the movie or not
The film has several great big name actors, which is another reason I like this one and would watch it based on the actors alone
I agree, there are quite a few great actors in Batman Begins. I like Liam Neeson too, even though he is one of the villains.
seeing the potential for great actors together on a big screen defiantly gets my interest. along with super heros and villans.  a good  rating does help me feel like I will not waste my time watching something awful
but the same time will not deter me from a film If i am just into the genre
I personally prefer good ratings. Even if a movie has many good actors, if it's rated poorly, I usually won't watch it in theaters.
I'm not sure if I agree with the Metacritic Score of 70/100, though.
The 84% on Rotten Tomatoes seems more accurate.
I will generally have enough patience to wait for a film to be released on DVD/Video if the rating turn me off.
What did you think of the bat scene in the movie?
I felt that scene shows the story of this film well, and is thought out.
I wonder if there was a better place for the bats besides a dry well, though.
batman as a child was good step by the filmm aker to show how his life started out
Because this movie is called Batman Begins, I agree that it was appropriate to show Bruce's beginnings.
I think it's ironic that the mugger's name is Joe Chill, but he isn't  chill if he murders people.
unlikely yes, I think they were going for a mysterious beginning to show how batman came to be.  but still want to leave some mystery as he still develops a phobia to   the bats
very ironic. mr chill is more of a bone  chilling murderer. 
He is also murdered too, so at least he gets what he deserves.
he got whats coming to him. but  bruce dosent get to murder him so i think that leaves him wanting revenge 
I think it helps to establish that Bruce will not directly murder anyone. Even when he burns down the League of Shadows, he doesn't directly kill Ra's al Ghul.
Injustice should be not be used as a reason to murder, in any case.
I feel hes lucky become part of the league of shadows, and to purge his fear of bats. this key part I think is pretty lucky break for him. as he is doing jail time in a foreign country.
It is strange that his family could afford a butler but he goes to prison for stealing...
I really like Gary Oldman as Gordon. He plays a good cop really well.
What did you think of the Scarecrow scenes?
The scarecrow was particularly scary character. trying to poison the water supply
and batman was poisoned with the fear-inducing drugs, I thought it was over for him.
It appeared to be over for many characters in this movie at different points, yeah.
I was surprised when the real Ra's al Ghul showed himself, too. The League of Shadows doesn't die easily.
He seems to have otherworldy power after surviving his past experiences
I don't see a paragraph about a movie. Is anyone else in here?
Hi! Have you seen the movie The Imitation Game?
I haven't. What's that about?
It's a 2014 American historical drama about real life cryptoanalyst Alan Turing.
Do you like biopics? If you do this movie might interest you.
It sounds interesting. What does Alan Turing do?
He decrypted German Intelligence codes for the British government during WWII. 
It has 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and average 7.7/10 and a Metacritic Score of 73/100. What ratings does a movie have to have for you to watch it? Or do you not consider ratings when deciding to watcha movie?
hello!
hi
Have you seen this movie?
Yes.
My boys love it!
I've watched it a lot of times.
It is such a cute movie
Who is your favorite character in Despicable Me?
I like Kevin
Who did you like
I like him too. My favorite is Lucy Wilde
I like Gru too. He tries to be such a tough guy
Yeah, he is a supervillain and admired by minions.
I like how the minions  all have a little different personality 
Who is the other minions you know aside from kevin?
bob
what was the other main character? Do you remember. 
Oh, I like bob too. I also like the personality of other minions.
I also remember Victor and Dr. Nefario.
Those girls really have Gru wrapped around their finger.
Lol, victor was the funny.
Yeah, Victor was really funny too. When was the last time you watched this movie?
probably like 6 months ago
I liked that the little guys win. 
Just goes to show that size doesn't matter
Oh, that was a long time ago. I watched it just last week. It was a 2010 movie but I love to watched it all over again.
Wow! Yeah, it's been awhile for me!
what is your favorite part of the movie?
When Gru gets his girls back. They really bring a while new meaning to his life. 
He would be so lost without the
*them
I love that part too.
My favorite part was when the minions is looking for a super villain.
Yeah, that was a great part too
do you think they'll make another one
Yeah, of course. Despicable me is a box office hit.
Sure, they will have a sequel.
Have a nice day!
hey, you too!
hello
Heyo

when people realized the guy stole john wicks car, everyone was like oh no...not john wick
I have watched the movie before
its super
anyways..gat to go now
nice chatting wit u
Have you seen this movie?
Yes, I have. 
I really enjoyed it. I love revenge movies
I as well, hitman movies are the best! 
Yes! And Keanu Reeves did such a great job
He always delivers! This movie had such an authentic B movie feel to it! 
Yeah! I loved it
I felt crushed when they killed his puppy though
IKR! Very violent film, destroyed a lot of stuff - how many black SUV's were trashed during the filming of this movie? 
HAHAHA! oh my god. SO TRUE! the infamous black SUV
I had totally forgotten that John Leuizamo was in this movie, he is like the ninja actor that shows up when you least expect it! 
Oh yeah! That's right. So many great actors in this movie
And they all looked so cool in their mafia suits
The movie has such an authentic criminal world feel to it. (cough cough) not that I would know what the criminal underworld looks like 
hahaha uh oh
oh and the Mustang was SICK!
The scene where the bad guy realizes that they just pissed off wick - priceless
I looooove mustangs
great selection of vehicles for the movie 
when a great assassain gets back into the business for revenge, ya'd better watch out! lol
hahah you know it!
it was a really fun movie
all behind a puppy! 
I would do the same for my dog in a heartbeat!
extremely  rare gem of a film 
Who was that lady assassain in the nightclub? Extremely beautiful   
Yeah, I'm surprised it only received a B rating on Rotten Tomatoes
kept rewinding her scenes! Great actress 
Ms. Perkins?
You know, sometimes the critics get it right and other times we just gotta judge for ourselves! 
That's her! 
Yeah I never really trust ratings. We all have different tastes. It's all subjective
That's Adrianne Palicki
Yes! I know her from other stuff, but she was too good in this movie. A great actress always makes you forget your watching a movie! 
yeah she was a great character!
Up uuuuuuntil she died. She broke the rules.....and rules are rules...lol
That last fistfight though! 
What do you think, better than Neo vs Agent smith? 
Wick went through the henchmen, and I was shocked when wick allowed himself to get stabbed! I literally said aloud "What are you doing?" 
Then I said "Oh, I see now!" lol 
I liked the final fight scene in Wick better than the matrix Just my opinion. 
and of course, at the end, wick gets a new puppy
what happens if the mailman accidentally maces' wicks' new dog? lol
haha sorry my internet got glitchy for second
but yeah! haha pretty funny
Hi!
Have you seen Real Steel?
No, haven't seen it. Have you?
No i haven't 
It's a sci-fi movie and i don't typically watch those
Not sure it's that good. It has a score of 59% on Rotten Tomatoes.
That's what I was thinking also
Actually, I kind of like sci-fi, but I'm picky.
Yes I can agree with that it depends for me
This one sounds more like an action flick in a sci-fi setting.
ah that would make sense 
it also has sports?
I thought more sci-fi because it was also a twilight zone episode
But the "Rocky with Robots" line makes me doubt that I would like it.
I didnt catch that but I'm with you 
I've never seen any Rocky's either
And I didn't know it was a Twilight Zone episode.
Ha! Me neither. Haven't seen the Rocky movies.
That's kind of odd to me i feel like most everyone has seen them 
The premise of this one is not so stupid though. Robot boxers. I feel it could become real at some point.
Rocky? Yeah I know, it was such a big movie.
But Stallone has never done anything for me.
No kidding I don't like any movies of his
This Real Steel movie has Hugh Jackman in it. He's not b ad.
But I don't mind Hugh Jackman
Haha we're thinking the same thing
Exactly. He looks like he has quite a few more IQ points than  Sylvester.
And he's better looking haha
Not difficult :-)
We're losing track of Real Steel though 
It sounds as though this is pretty predictable as well and I like movies that I can't guess  the end
The whole Real Steel story seems like a series of machinations of bad guys against good guys, without much else.
Same here. This one sounds like it's been writ ten by committee.
Right I do like that it's a a family movie- I don't have kids but I feel like it would be ok for my nephew
I really don't think it's my type of movie.
Me either but sometimes it's about the kids and a little boy would like the robots and battles
Yeah, maybe it's OK for kids. They like the predictable storylines.
well not "little" but grade school
Still... the good guys against bad guys works well at that age.
Hey, how are you?
Do you like Monsters University?
I do, I thought Billy did a good job as Mike
Yeah Billy Crystal is great. Who is your favorite character?
Mike was. Monster U is cute and funny and the animation, though not exactly inspired, has a lot of color.
I really liked all the comedy in it. And the music
The comedy is true to the spirit of Monsters Inc and matches its tone but never seemed content to turn over old ground. The music hit all the right notes I think
I agree, it was a very safe bet for Pixar with how they presented it.
Superstar actors doing voice acting is always going to make money, though.
I agree, it has enough stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz of cuteness has melted away. For a mere prequel, that's a good result.
I liked the whole fraternity aspect of it, very tongue in cheek.
Yes, it was a refreshing outlook on the series as a whole and provided a nice background for the characters.
I thought the scene of Mike at 7 years old was a good call-back too.
I agree, I liked when they show Mike's background story of why he became a scarer. I always wondered why he chose to do that
I also like how they show the friendship between Mike and Sully develop
Yeah I never thought of Sully as the cool guy iike that
I didn't know Sully had such a pretentious  background compared to other characters. It explains why only he was accepted into Roar Omega Roar.
True, and it does do a good job of showing how both characters are flawed.
I thought the whole Scare Games plot was a fairly good one too, kept it interesting.
I agree, I like that they didn't try to make them perfect. 
Yes! And so much was at stake for them in that game as well
It would decide if they could be renerolled or not. How do you feel about how Sully cheated?
I thought it was delaying the inevitable and giving them a false sense of accomplishment.
I agree, I felt bad for Mike who thought he succeeded on his own terms but instead was helped to win
I thought it was ironic too since they only get eliminated from the first challenge because another team was diqualified for cheating.
Yes I agree. It ended up causing them to become expelled from the university as well
I feel like they sacrificed themselves for the rest of the fraternity to get accepted though.
I agree and I think that it was a noble thing to do. At least they still were able to be hired at Monsters, Inc. and work their way up to becoming scarers.
Yeah, guess it shows that you don't need education sometime! Haha.
Exactly, sometimes all that's needed is preservation  and hardwork!
At least they didn't get in a lot of trouble with the CDA
Yeah I was taken aback when Hardscrabble said they were the first students to surprise her.
I agree, I thought they weren't too special. All in all it was a great movie!
Hey, there's this movie called Bruce Almighty with Jim Carrey in it, have you seen it or would you like to?
I haven't seen it.
Have you seen it?
What's it about?
I have seen it, it's really funny. It's a comedy made in 2003 about a down on his luck tv reporter who complains to god and in return becomes god for a week
 I like comedies. Is Jim Carrey pretty good in it?
it is known as one of his best films, so I would say yes, it is very slapstick comedy
Is it also a romance?
no, it's a comedy
no it is not
Too bad. I like romantic comedies.
Does being God work out for him?
Hello
Hello
How are you?
I love Ryan Gosling in this movie.
I'm good, you?
I think he and Rachel McAdams had fine performances!
Yes!
This movie will definitely always be one of their best well known projects.
I loved it but I'm so surprised by the ratings on it.
Now is the 52% based on critic reviews or users?
I don't know. I thought everybody loved this movie lol!
To me the older versions of themselves really struck a chord with me.
Maybe it wasn't as great based on its technical merits
Sometimes movies can be enjoyable regardless
Possibly. To me it's just the perfect example of two lovers forever struggling to be together.
Yup I agree with that
Thats actually a great way to put it
Did you have a favorite scene?
The older versions of themselves was just the most touching part of this movie. Till the end they stayed together even when she no longer knew who he was. It's just so touching.
Yeah, it was so sad at how alzheimers just eats away at your memory like that. 
I don't have a favorite lol. I just loved this movie as a whole. Some parts and scenes were more touching than others but it's just an overall love for the entire movie.
Yes it is.
I can't imagine losing my counterpart like that.
I can't believe that its been out for 14 years though! I saw it at the theaters too lol
Me either! I dont know which is worse, having somebody die completely, or just their memory
Yeah it's been a long time since I saw it but I still remember it like it was yesterday lol
I know!
Yeah, really makes me think. 
It does. 
Now I have the urge to watch it again lol
Good thing I still have it on DVD
I've always hated the way parents intercepted relationships the way Anne did. Keeping people apart based on money.
I'll wait until the wifey gets home though.. that should get me out of the dog house :)
Lol. I'd love to see it again myself.
Hi! How are you? Seen any good movies lately?
yeah, Frozen
Sounds like a cold movie! Can you tell me what it's about? 
Its about two girls Anna and Elsa
Anna is a princess
and Elsa is her younger sister
Gotcha! Is it a movie for children or adults or both?
Difficult to say, probably for both
Well I like kids movies just as much as adult ones sometimes! Did you really enjoy watching it? 
well,  its been acclaimed as the best musical made by Disney
I'm trying to find a good movie to watch tonight. 
Sounds like a hit then! Disney movies are always excellent. 
yeah, its also 3D animated, the visual are really good
even rotten tomatoes gave it 89%
Not a bad review for Rotten Tomatoes! I
Is it fairly new or a few years old?
well,  it came out in 2013
So fairly new. At least compared to some of the other Disney princess movies!
Can you tell me what the basic plot is?
Don't give too much away though! I don't want to know the ending!
ahaahah, ok
the plot is really good, magic things, talking animals, its exactly what we want from Disney
Perfect! 
I think I have found my movie for tonight! 
Thanks so much for your recommendation!
Sure, no problem! Its also very emotional, so you may need some tissues :)
All the best ones are tear jerkers! I'll be sure to have them handy along with some good snacks.
yeah, the ending is definitely not what you would expect it to be 
Is it a happy ending at least?
well, you have to see it yourself
not to spoil it
the only hint I will give you is that it gets "political" at the end 
True! I hope it's a happy ending! Is this a Disney movie that has a sequel?
actually, I don't know
Well since it's so new they may have not made one yet. But since it had such great reviews I'm sure they will! I
I'll tell you if I enjoyed watching it but I'm sure I will! 
Hey, what's the movie name?
hello
I am reading the document, lets see, ok RE AL STEEL
HAve you seen it?
Oh I remember that, I haven't seen it but it's about fighting robots.
Did it get good reviews?
Interesting, in this write up, it does not mention robots until the last sentence
Do you remember who starred in the movie?
The wolverine actor. Can't remember his name.
Hugh Jackman
Yeah, that's it!
Also stars Dakota Goyo, but I do not know her at all (assuming iy is a woman)
You never know these days with names but I'd guess you are right!
That was probably Hugh's love interest in the movie.
Maybe not, the role is "Max'
I think that is Hugh's kid in the movie. 
so I guess we were wrong
Do you know how long it is? I'm not that interested in super long movies anymore.
also stars Evangeline Lilly (woman for sure"
Yeah, that must be the love interest.
Did you like the movie
The plot makes it seem like WWE
I haven't seen it. It looked ok in the previews though.
how so?
Fighting Robots
From what I remember, this is in the future so instead of humans fighting, robots fight.
and I guess Hugh used to be good at robot fighting but then they had some problems and they weren't good anymore.
But then they find a better robot and are good again.
seemed like a simplistic popcorn movie from the previews
I guess not WWE, but boxing, less humans, just robots
yeah
Honestly it seems dumb, orobably why I did not see it
probably made my disney too, so it could be a kiddy movie
does not sound kiddy
I don't think it was a mature movie though, it was marketed towards kids (teens)
not little kids
like the kind of movie you'd take a 14 year old to
In fact now that I read this, it sounds like one of the movies that is so stupid it might be "stupid enjoyable"
Yeah, it definitely sounds like that.
probably a feel good movie where they conquer all
Does it say what kind of problems they have in that document?
like what the main plot is about
This also sounds like that , I think, Brad pitt movie about underground fight venues
yeah except nobody is crazy like the brad pitt character
Illegal, mush be done out of the view of the law
I don't think it was illegal
maybe though
I remember there were crowds of people cheering them on
like it was an athletic specacle 
the write up says Now working as a small-time promoter, Charlie pieces together scrap metal into low-end fighters, barely earning enough to make it from one underground venue to the next. 
yup that's the struggle
then they find an amazing robot and get their revenge
so he starts out as illegal, then moves up in the world
makes sense
do you know if the robots have an intelligence?
Rotten Tomatos 59% rating
who cares about rotten tomatoes, their reviews are worthless
Says it was made by Dream Works, is that adisney company?
look up your fav movies on that site and I guarantee you'll be disappointed  by the low scores. 
no I think they compete with disney
they make similar animated movies
It seems Disney buys up everyone
yeah, they are a giant company. 
gives another rating of 56% (Metric score) ???
that is probably a rating at a different site
I've done this before and usually they provide 3 rating systems
rottoen tomatoes, something else then a cine something rating
Also stars Olga Fonda, is she related to Jane Fonda/Henry Fonda?
I have no idea
Yes a CinemaScore:A
they always have suspiciously high ratings
seems like Olga was born in Russia, so no, much better looking than Henry or Jane
lol
I think we're done now, thanks for the chat!
ok
bye
Hello!
hey, what's up
have you watched la la land before?
Yes. I really appreciated how much thought went into the movie's title. I think it's really cool how it refers to Los Angeles, music, and having your head in the clouds all at once. It's really spectacular how they summed up so many elements of the movie in such a short title
Have you seen it?
yep -  i watched it because critics seemed to like it
I agree with most of the critics in the paper
Yes. I especially agree with the review that La La Land is successful at showing the hardships that are involved with chasing a dream
I disagree with the two reviews that the film is dull and that the middle was boring. I really found the entire movie to be enthralling. 
yep, i agree with you - i do believe we have to cut emma stone and ryan gosling some slack, since they're not singers
Agreed. I really liked the scene where Sebastian improvs jazz music when he is supposed to be playing Christmas music only. 
It was one of those scenes that really stuck with me after I watched the movie
would you do that, if you were in his position?
I'm not sure. I liked how that was when Mia first heard Sebastian sing and was truly moved by it. I think it was interesting way to initiate their relationship
yeah, it was just sad how he brushed her off, since things could've been different
I do like how the next time Mia sees Sebastian he is also singing. I also liked how she kind of teased him by requesting a song she knew he would hate to sing
do you usually watch musicals?
Occasionally. I also enjoyed the development of Sebastian and Mia's relationship, such as when Mia decides to begin writing a play all by herself because Sebastian suggests it to her. I feel like the two of them really grow as individuals when they get into a relationship
I enjoyed that part too, since it also shows how hard both of them are working to achieve their dreams
they both want to become successful in their separate areas, but they have to struggle a lot
Right. I feel like the review that mentions the cruelty that's involved in following your dreams really sums it up. The film is not afraid to show how much hard work and hardship is involved in making it big
i also thought it was difficult for sebastian to take keith's offer
i mean, he gets paid, but it's not something he wants to do. This happens in life a lot
I agree. It must be hard to do something you're not passionate about- especially when it's something you must do in order to one day live out your dreams
What did you think of the scene when Mia and Sebastian get into a fight about Mia thinking Sebastian is giving up on his dreams?
it was definitely well acted, and i sympathize with both of them
but i think sebastian was harsh when he said that mia liked him more when he was unsuccessful
It truly was heartbreaking when Mia moved back home to Nevada
i feel he didn't want to hear the truth, because he was really giving up on his dreams
it really was sad
I agree. It was also a very unpredictable plot twist. I did not see it coming at all
would you say that was the low point in the movie?
Yes but I wouldn't say any part of the movie "sagged badly" as one review claims
i agree - overall, i would recommend the movie to a friend
I agree. As another review points out it was a "genuinely romantic comedy", which I completely agree with because I feel as though Sebastian and Mia's relationship was not as cliche as many love stories are in movies. I appreciated the realness of their relationship
yes, that was one thing i loved about the movie - while it was sad, it was not a cliche ending
I agree. I think Damien Chazelle really did a good job directing the film. 
i'm curious, are you an ai
if so, i was completely fooled
I am not! 
But I really was surprised that someone reviewed Sebastian as a "jazz snob" because I did not get that vibe at all
yeah, i disagreed with that characterization, but i can see why someone might say that.
he is a purist, or whatever they called it in the film
I also really didn't think Mia's character lacked depth. I think she was a rather round character, especially with the large amount of independence she possessed. It took a lot of courage for her to move back to Nevada
yes, i thought her character was pretty nuanced, but i'm not sure it being courageous of her to move back to Nevada. After the play didn't go well, I think that was her only option
*about it
I suppose you have a point. I just think she was more independent of the average woman portrayed in films as she didn't cling on to Sebastian when things didn't work out for her. 
although I wish they reconciled before achieving their dreams
the bit at the end that showed what could have been actually made me sad
I agree! It was very sad but also, as one reviewer puts it quite "bittersweet." I wasn't sure how to feel at the end. 
It was nice discussing the film with you! Have a great day!
you guys have a pretty good ai system
i was actually completely fooled
hi
hey
Have you seen Dunkirk?
 no,not yet
Are you familiar with Christopher Nolan?
yes
He co-produced it.
great director
I think he shot it in 65 mm large format...which is rare these days.
wht is the genere of the movie
is it action or drama
Both, but mostly action.
what is the story plot
WWII
itkes us to history
Follows the story of a private who retreats with thousands of others to the beach of Dunkirk awaiting rescue.
rescue from ?
The war is over but not everybody knows it yet.
it seems like postwar story
Just at the end...they have a tough time getting off the beach.
They get really lucky several times.
It is pretty intense.  In one scene they are hiding out in a trawler that is beached and decide to wait in it for high tide.
is their any adventure like huge animals in the movie
No huge animals.  Some of the enemy forces decide to take target practice on the trawler and when the tide finally comes in...it nearly sinks.
Ships keep coming in to rescue them but the lines are ridiculous.
finally they got a ship to get out of the place right
I think it is historically correct.  In the end, more than 300000 are rescued.
They get on several ships, one is torpedoed and sinks and they escape through a hatch.
it seems like movie titanic at the end
some are sinking and ships are damaged,people are fighting for survival
A big sigh of relief...kind of like Titanic.  They do eventually get rescued...although not all of them:)
it has war scenes or only posrwar scenes
War scenes...more like just following these guys and their experiences and what people would do to escape (assume dead, pretend to be from another country)
Civilians are sent to rescue most of them on family owned fishing vessels.
At one point there is a large oil slick on the water and it gets ignited and causes a pretty graphic scene.
seems intresting,who is the lead actor,this is the last question
Fionn Whitehead plays Tommy, the British Army private I told you about.
See it for the special effects.
yes,I will
Oh and the scenery.
its nice to have chat with u,have a good day
Much like Titanic, critics called it a masterpiece.  Good day!
bye
Hi!
Hello!
I just saw Iron Man.  It was awesome!
Oh cool! What's it about?
It's about a Superhero called Iron Man, in real non-superhero life he's a genius inventor.
It's got Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man aka Tony Stark.
I really like him. Was he good in it?
Yes!  There are some other big names starring in it too!
Like who?
It's got Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's assistant and he has a crush on her.
Then there's Jeff Bridges as the next in charge at Stark Industries, Downey's company.
Nice! Do they hook up in the end?
Do you really want to know or do you want to wait for when you watch it?
Stark is kind of a playboy.
The plot is awesome too.
That figures. I guess I'll wait.  Who directed it?
Jon Favreau directed it, it got pretty good critics' scores.
What were the reviews?
CinemaScore gave it an A, and Rotten Tomatoes was 94%.
Wow that is pretty good. So what happens with the plot?
Stark gets captured by terrorists and is held prisoner in a cave in Afghanistan.
They have to put a device in his chest because he gets injured in a blast and it keeps the shrapnel that they can't remove from reaching his heart.
So they want to keep him alive? Why?
The terrorist group is called Ten Rings, they want him to manufacture a Jericho missile for them.
I see. So how does he escape?
Let me just say he gets away and doesn't build the missile. 
But when he gets back to his company he finds out one of his employees is secretly working as an arms dealer.
Dirty mole!
So what does he do with him?
He foils the attack on a village the terrorists are trying to destroy, donned in his Iron Man gear flying around all Superhero-like.
His mole of an employee builds a suit like his, and they end up duking it out.
Ah ha! So naturally Iron prevails right?
Just before the ending the two of them are fighting atop the Stark Industries tower.
Go on!
Stark doesn't have the new reactor to charge his Iron Man suit that the other guy has, so he's getting whooped pretty bad.
You sure you want to know the ending?
Nope. Let's not spoil it. Thanks!
hi
hello!
The movie that was picked, I'
I've never seen. 
This movie is awesome!
What was the title of the movie?
Real Steel
Oh, who's in it?
Sounds like an action movie.
Hugh Jackman 
I love Hugh Jackman!!
What year was it released?
2011
Is it an action or drama?
its an action movie
I thought so, sounds interesting.
What score did Rotten Tomatoes give?
59%
That's pretty low...but I don't always agree with critics...
People seemed to like it
Who directed the movie?
Shawn Levy
Anything else you can tell me about the movie?
its like rocky but with robots
Is Hugh Jackman a robot?
Or does he play a human?
You think it's a good movie to watch with kids? 
he is a human
yeah i do
I couldn't imagine Hugh Jackman as a robot...lol
Who else is in the movie?
D akota Goyo
I don't think I know who that is...
yeah
Not a romantic date movie then...
I wouldnt say so
Hi there
Hey
So what did you think of the movie?
I think it would be an interesting movie to watch
what about you?
It seemed pretty inspirational, most movies that portray the struggle into success is worth watching.
Yes, it looks like Michael Oher experience a lot of hardship growing up.
experienced*
Yeah, seems like he beat the odds drastically. It just goes to show you that hard work and a little bit of luck can get you far in life.
I agree.
He definitely made it from the bottom.
Yeah you got that right
I had no idea Sandra Bullock was in this to be honest
And Tim McGraw
Those are some big names.
Haha I was about to say that
It has some great reviews too.
I can't believe he ran away at a young age. Can't blame him though, it's hard to go through normal life when a family member is on drugs all the time
Seems he had some good luck with some good people that helped him get into school and football.
I agree. The two individuals that adopted him changed his life forever
Definitely, it also shows what kind of person he is by him withholding his strength at first
It is a shame that Leigh Anne's friends did not approve of what she was doing.
Yeah it's sad how people judge just because they don't understand the situation.
Though thank goodness Leigh Anne is strong willed
Yep, they pass judgement too soon and without all of the information
Yes, she is definitely strong.
It's crazy how he was approached by gang members when he went to go see his biological mother.
It's good that he chose the right path though
That must have been a scary situation for him.
True, but it made him stronger of a person. It also most likely made him realize he didn't belong with the criminals especially after they were making sexual comments about the same person who was taking care of him
That is what probably made him decide that life was not for him. When someone talks that way about someone you love you know they are not your true friend.
Hi there!
Hello, have you seen Monsters University? 
John Wick is a good action movie, do you agree?
hey there\
yes i am agree
i love action movies
Me too.
There were some Russian mobsters in the movie.
He came out of retirement when his wife got killed.
yes 
The critics gave it a 86% score.  That's pretty good for an action movie.
That was rotten tomatoes.  Metacritic gave it a 68/100
yeah i saw that
i watched movies with better score
It said his wife died but gave him the puppy.  So his vengeance was for the theft of his car and the death of his puppy.
yeah but it was not a logical story
nobody have a vengeance for their puppy got killed
do you watch the climax
It is what they call neo-noir.  I guess that means it is not supposed to make sense because it is an altered reality.
Yes I watched the whole movie.
i watched some scenes
The idea was that he was a hit man who retired so he could hand out with his wife.
but now whole movie
oh that's nice
Sorry hang out.
a retired hit man
So his wife got the puppy and then she died of natural causes or di sease or something.
so that's movie with lots of action
oh that's too bad
so he find he whoever did that
She got him the puppy, then after she died they killed his puppy and stole his car.
Yes  that's what the movie is about.  The Russian mobster's son did it.
so what will happen in climax?
So he just went to kill that guy and in order to do it he had to go through a lot of Russian mobsters.
Let me check if they have that info.
sorry i didn't watch the whole film
At the end he was able to go to Iosef's safe house and kill him.
oh interesting
k bro lets finish the chat
He also killed the dad because the dad was mad that his son died and tried to kill him.
thank you for your valuable time to chat with me
good bye
Ok you think we have enough then.
Ok.
ok bro
shall we continue?
do you like we can
Yeah I have fifteen thanks.
hello
hi
I've never seen this movie, but looks to have some good actresses
I have seen it. It was very good, and yes the actresses were great. I can't believe rotten tomatoes gave it such a low score
that is quite low
I enjoy dark fantasy flicks, so I may enjoy this one
Disney has been doing well with their live action movies on classic disney movies. And yes i do believe you'll like it if you like dark fantasy. It gives a new take on maleficent. 
Plus the visuals were amazing
I heard the visuals were great
Disney really knows how to create some great visuals that's for sure lol
Robert Stromberg has done some good work
Oh yeah, the Moors, that forest.  I remember that
I'm not quite familiar with him. What other movies has he done?
he did the production design on Avatar
and alice in wonderland
King Henry says whoever kills Maleficent will be named his successor and marry his daughter.  
o I love those movies as well
The Moors got turned into a dark kingdom after Stefans betrayal.
hello?
Hi
The Movie is Catch me if you can and you should absolutely go see it!
Really
Q
Why
It has a 96% on Rotten Tomatoes and has Tom Hanks as well as Amy adams in it
Oh
It is directed by Speilburg 
Ok
It follows Frank Abagnale Jr  who before his 19th birthday conned millions of dollars from people posing as a pilot and even a doctor
do you have any questions about the film?
are you still there?
hello?
The movie is from 2002
Leonardo Dicaprio is in it
Christopher Walken and Martin SHeen are also in this film in supporting roles
His primary crime was check fraud
Some critics thought it was a bit long
 Some critics found the film very funny. Moreso than any actual comedies
It was a biographic film
Cinema Score gave it an A-
Hi there
Hi, I just saw Dunkirk
You did? I have wanted to see that since I first heard about it. How was it?
I don't like war movies. 
Was the acting any good?
hello?
Yeah, acting is good but the effects are better. However, I don't like war movies and can't recommend it, even though it is a visual feast. 
are you  not recommending it just because you personally don't like war movies or for another reason?
I also like dialogue. But there is little of that. It's mostly an action flick. 
so if I like war movies, it sounds like this one has a lot of action and good acting, I would like it?
was it a long movie?
Maybe. It's also very "artsy", something critics like. If you like going to museums and looking at meaningless stuff then maybe. If not, stay home.
was it graphic, like lots of blood and guts?
can you respond a little quicker please
Yes. Graphic. Little dialogue. Visually gripping but pretentious like an impressionist painting.
how are impressionist paintings pretentious? 
That is my impression. 
were there any famous actors or actresses in it?
It's not long though. 106 minutes,
ok, that is pretty short for a war movie
have you heard any reviews of it?
No one famous in it. Fionn Whoitehead. Never heard of him bbefore. Jack Lowden
Great reviews from critics. But critics like artsy stuff. They were deeply moved. 
Is it better than Saving Private Ryan?
I didn't like that one either. So even.
How was the soundtrack?
I don't recall There was a lot of sound, but mostly of war. If you see it, go to a cinema with a great sound system. 
Do you remember who directed it?
You definitely need surround sound.
Chirstopher Nolan directed. Is he any good?
I think he is
Where was it filmed?
It's set in France. WWII. It's about the British Army. Churchill makes an appearance.
Hello.
I liked The wolf of Wall Street,
Does the wolf of wall street look like a good movie?
Of course, what if and to you?
There are not so many movies about the topic "stockbroker" that I know of.
there is almost no
I can't quite understand why it rated so badly on Rotten Tomatoes.
How did Leonardo do it for you?
With only 7.8/10 .
I liked him as Jordan Belfort.
excellent character
Did you like the whole plot of the movie?
Sure, I enjoyed the plot.
Do you think that what they did was wrong?
Hmm, you mean the big scheme in the end?
No, I guess that is just how the business runs.
Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff?
Do you remember that character?
what good paper did
Yes. I liked that one too.
It took the FBI quite a long time to get them.
It's interesting how people come up on Wall Street, would you like to be one of them?
It seems to me that Jordan's wife was just for the money she had
I guess that time has passed. Nowadays most of the trade is digital I guess.
So that part of the spirit of Wall Street is gone.
Yes, he married the wrong wife.
Would you like a new version of the movie?
Yes. A modern version would be interesting.
It might be a bit more like IT Crowd.
You add something more to the movie?
Metacritic Score: 75/100 I think it was very low and you?
In 1987 the country to go for money laundering is still Switzerland.
The critics rated it too low for my feeling.
Goodnight.
I liked the movie
hi
Hello! How are you?
good
let's talk about Batman Begins. Are you familiar?
2005 SuperHero movie directed by Christopher  Nolan
Yes, I've heard of it. I just havent seen it yet
It's great
Rotten Tomatoes: 84% and average: 7.7/10
Metacritic Score: 70/100
CinemaScore: A
the most 'realistic' take on batman yet
I'm actually interested in seeing it. Doesn't it have Christain Bale as Batman?
yes
It stars Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, and Morgan Freeman.
great cast
Wow, even Morgan Freeman!? That is a good cast. Who does Freeman play?
He plays Lucious Fox. He's like Batman's Q (from 007)
the tech guy who helps him out. So it's less of a one-man operation
Yes, I remember the Character from the comics. That's awesome that they put him in the film. Does he play a big role? or is he just seen a little bit?
A fairly significant role. More-so in the sequels.
Also stars Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard, a devious villian and member of the League of Shadows
That is really cool, normally they give those kinds of characters small roles.
The league of shadows is in the film!? Wait so that means Neeson is Ras Algul?
Special guest appearance by Ken Watanabe as Ras Al Ghul
Do they mention his immortality in the film?
It's hinted at, but it's implied it's a mantle that's passed down for a more realistic take
As a child, Bruce Wayne falls down into a dry well and is attacked by a swarm of bats, subsequently developing a phobia of the creatures. While watching an opera with his parents, Thomas and Martha, Bruce becomes frightened by performers masquerading as bats and asks to leave. Outside, mugger Joe Chill murders Bruce's parents in front of him. Orphaned, Bruce is raised by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth.
Ah so they stick to the comic closely, thats a good thing.
Michael Caine must be Alfred. I can't see him playing anyone else.
Yes, origin-wise, it's pretty close. Bruce's traveling around the world and training is a part of it. Which has never been shown on screen before.
Yes he's an amazing Alfred
Fourteen years later, Chill is freed in exchange for testifying against Gotham City mafia boss Carmine Falcone. Bruce intends to murder Chill, but one of Falcone's assassins does so first. Bruce's childhood friend, assistant district attorney Rachel Dawes, berates him for attempting to undermine the justice system, saying that his father would be ashamed. Bruce confronts Falcone, who tells him that real power comes from being feared. Bruce decides to travel the world and learn how to confront injustice. While serving a prison sentence for theft in Bhutan, he meets Henri Ducard, who trains him as a member of the League of Shadows, led by Ra's al Ghul. After completing his training and purging his fears, Bruce learns that the League intends to destroy Gotham, believing it to be corrupt, decadent, hypocritical and beyond saving. Bruce rejects the League's cause and burns down their temple during his escape. Ra's is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves the unconscious
I can only imagine the sarcastic jokes he makes in the film. Caine is perfect for that character.
He has some gread monolouges
Batman intercepts a drug shipment, provides Rachel with evidence against Falcone, and enlists Sergeant James Gordon, one of the few honest cops left in Gotham, to arrest him. In prison, Falcone meets with Dr. Jonathan Crane, a corrupt psychiatrist whom he has helped smuggle drugs into Gotham, and threatens to reveal his complicity if he does not declare  him mentally unfit for trial. Crane puts on a scarecrow mask and sprays Falcone with a fear- inducing hallucinogen that drives him insane (which causes Falcone to constantly mouth the  word "Scarecrow"), and has him transferred to Arkham Asylum. While investigating "the Scarecrow", Batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated. He is saved by Alfred and given an antidote developed by Fox. When Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, Crane reveals that he has been pouring his fear-inducing drug into Gotham's water supply. He drugs Rachel with it, but Batman saves her and subdues Crane, who claims to work for Ra's al Ghul. Batman evades the police to get Rachel to safety, administers the antidote, and gives her a vial of it for Gordon and another for mass production. Ducard reappears at Bruce's birthday party and reveals himself to be the true Ra's al Ghul. Having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from Wayne Enterprises, he plans to vaporize Gotham's water supply, rendering Crane's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city. He sets Wayne Manor aflame and leaves Bruce to die, but Alfred rescues him.
Interesting Scarecrow is even in the film. That seems like a lot of plot if they have multiple villans in the film.
How was the story in your opinion?
It does not crowd the film in my opinion. Unlike how it turned out with Batman and Robin.
You can have multiple villians as long as you use them correctly
I thought it was a great story. OVerall very solid
I agree,  does the League ever bump heads with Crane in the film?
Or do they work together?
Yes, and it fits naturally.
Hi

hi
hey
have you Dunkirk?
seen?
no what is that?
its the movie we need to discuss
then discuss cause I have nt seen it. but I see christopher nolan directed it
Yep, my Favourite director
it seems dunkirk was his latest project and has gotten high marks across the board
I have a watched all his movies but missed out in this one
yep appreciated critically and commercially  
after this movie DUNKIRK. I wonder why he hasnt been more mainstream
frankly his movies have got lot more meaning and are more fun at the same time
make me really want to figure out what other films besides DUNKIRK that he also did besides DUNKIRK.
The batman series, Interstellar, Inception
just to name a few
are we allowed to do that? I mean it is kind of to stay on topic when both of us havent seen dunkirk
so its a war movie?
well then...after rewatching his first batman move i felt that he took inspirations for the first batman animation series cause the way the night life were. it was almsot always dark and yellow
yes
i heard the movies is depressing in here?
well..it is a war film don't know how you can make it light hearted and they have germany  so...
yea thats true, also Nolan isnt known for his sense of humour
oh just remmbered why 1940 was so captivating. it was the start of WWII so...thats makes it even more depressing
The critics have given it a rave reviews, and it has a good chance at he oscars
of course I havent' caught on to what style nolan has, like michael bay and tim burton all have their styles
True that
I dont liike the actor in interstellar, that matthew guy. somesthing off about him
there Tom Hardy, Harry s tyles
tom hardy a director? when that happened?
No the Actor
yyep exactly is he good?
fwfwfwfw
hello?
hello
I know a movie you may like
What's the movie about?
It's actually sort of a musical
That's great! I love musicals. Are there any big name actors in the movie?
Ryan Gosling
Nice! It looks like the movie has pretty great ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and other review sites
It also has Emma Stone
Do you think you would like the movie?
I would love it.
I think I would love it as well
The critics love it.
do you like dancing in movies?
I do! 
What do you think of the two key scenes? Which one sounds more interesting to you?
I would like the first one just to see someone playing music soulfully
I agree. I think that scene sounds interesting
I just saw it has John Legend in it
Isn't he, like, a legend or something?
Haha I think so! 
I think the new scene, where Mia decides to write a one-woman play sounds cool
It's in LA.
I do like the setting
She does sound like a cool character
I'm more of a New York person myself
They both sound interesting. New York is a great place as well! 
LA is so flat isn't it?
And all that nasty stuff in the news about Hollywood
Yeah, it is. And expensive! 
The warm climate is appealing though
Do you like jazz?
I can appreciate jazz, but it's not one of my favorite genres. Do you?
not my favorite either
I prefer more forethought and craftsmanship in my music
improv doesn't suit me
I agree with that. I do appreciate that a contemporary movie is bringing jazz into it. Jazz isn't usually found in mainstream movies 
gotta go. peace.
Have you seen mean girls
No, but I'm interested in it. 
What's it about?
Its really good. Its a high school movie about a new girl entering a school that is run by a group of mean girls
its a comedy
It sounds pretty good.
What actors are in it?
Its probably lindsey lohans best movie
also has rachel mcadams and amanda seyfried
Wow, that's a lot of good actresses
I think I remember Tina Fey being in that one too.
Also Tim Meadows.
Yeah its a goof cast
When did it come out?
good*
it came out in 2004
its a solid movie
Wow I can't believe it's been 14 years since it came out
That's bananas
Yeah its gone by fast it seems like
How long is the movie, if I decided to watch it?
its a little under 2 hours
its an easy watch
Oh, that's good.
Did they ever make a sequel?
they did not
it was a one off
Well, I will have to check it out then
Do you think it's on Netflix?
You should
 I am sure its on a streaming service somewhere
Awesome, I'll look it up!
Thank you! Nice talking to you!
Hello
 Hi 
 Looks like we got monsters University 
Ok
 Iâve never seen it 
Me either
I had picked the shape of water
  I had home alone
Lol
I've seen that at least
 It looks like Billy Crystal in the movie 
Ok
 Itâs seem to do OK on rotten tomatoes I got a 79% 
Yeah no kids so not great with kids movies
That's pretty good
 Thatâs OK Iâve got a bunch information from We  can figure it out 
4 stars on umdb too
imdb
 Oh John Goodmanâs in this too and kind of suprised Steven buscemi  is in this 
That's a good cast
He normally plays really creepy bad  guys
Haha totally
 Looks like monster Hunter has something like fraternity or sorority games called scary games 
 Oops monsters University Iâve been playing monster Hunter sorry 
 Maybe itâs to teach kids to challenge themselves 
Oops did I lose you
Hello!
Hello so the movie we will be talking about is Batman V. Superman
Great! I haven't actually seen that yet, but have been really wanting to. Which actors play Batman and Superman?
The actors are really great and you probably know all of them. Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, and Jesse Eisenberg to name a few.
Oh, that is a great cast? Henry Cavill played Superman in the latest Superman film right?
Sorry, a great cast!
I am not sure but the film is still a part of the DC extended universe. Also it will be featuring wonder woman.
Ooh, that is excellent. I am looking forward to seeing Wonder Woman! Are Batman and Superman enemies at the start of the film?
Well lex luthor manipulates batman into a battle with Superman because he is obssessed with cloning superman.
Oh! So Batman is supposed to bring Superman to Lex Luthor?
No that is not the case however he is manipulated into helping. By the way did I mention this is going to be the first time batman and superman are in a movie together?
Really? The first time? That seems pretty amazing knowing that the characters have been around for so long! Very cool. Is the story set in Metropolis or Gotham?
The film appears to take place in both cities, and Batman comes to view Superman as a threat to humanity.
That is interesting, to have the film set in both cities. So Batman sees it as his duty somewhat to take Superman down?
Well the relationships of the characters are quite complex because Clark Kent A.K.A. Superman learns of Batman's justice methods and tries to expose him. All this happening while Lex luthor makes moves to get approval to obtain kryptonite from a senator.
Interesting. And so, I imagine Lois Lane is in this story? If so, does she serve a greater purpose? Does she know both superheroes?
Maybe but I am not sure. By the way do you usually care about reviews?
I will often read reviews to see what people have to say, but I don't change my mind about wanting to see a movie based on reviews. I think that I can't really know unless I see for myself. Do you care about reviews?
Not usually I like to be my own judge however if the reviews are overwhelmingly bad or good then it may influence whether or not I watch in theatres. I have to say for this movies though the reviews are quite mixed. 
Did you enjoy this film?
I did. I really liked seeing the scenes where batman manages to subdue the superman.
Cool. I guess that's one of the ultimate questions, which one could beat out the other. Do they team up at all in the film ?
Yes in Batman chooses to save Supermans mother while Superman confonts Lex.
Oh wow! The pairing of Batman and Superman's mom is a really cool part of the story, heartwarming.
I know but the film ends with sadly the death of Superman.
Oh wow! I am surprised by that, I thought they would keep their story line going for another movie or two. 
Dont worry the dirt on top of the coffin vibrates a nice wink from the Director.
Haha! That's the closing shot?!
I believe so it is in the last scene.
Awesome! Take care.
Jim Carrey is a great actor that has had a lot of major roles in movies. What is your favorite movie with Jim Carrey?
I enjoyed Liar Liar the most. He has a lot of good movies though. What did you like about Bruce Almighty?
I enjoyed that Bruce Almighty was a comedy because I enjoy a good laugh. I also liked how the movie introduced God, which not many movies do. What did you like most about Bruce Almighty?
Do you think that the movie deserves the rating that it received?
Yes I liked the role of Morgan Freeman as "God" also. I also like the setting of the movie which is memorable to me because Im from Buffalo. 
I think it was rated pretty low. What score would you have given it?
Oh that is interesting! Morgan Freeman is another great actor. His voice can be used in many settings and roles. 
I think that it should have been rated higher. It seems like rotten tomatoes always gives low ratings though.
Wasn't there a sequel to this movie?
Do you feel like this movie was a breakout movie for Jim Carrey?
Im not 100% sure. But it did have like an open end to the movie
I think that he has a lot of recognition for being in this movie. But I am not sure of other movies he was in before this one. 
I think Ace Ventura and the Mask may have come out before this. Not sure 
I also enjoyed him in the Grinch movie. He is able to perform many different roles across many genres of movies. 
Has he played any serious movie roles like a drama? 
I am not sure about that. He seems to be more of a comedian type actor. 
Do you know any other movies by this director?
If you were in a similar situation as Bruce (like in the key scene mentioned), would you feel frustrated as well?
I have not heard of any other movies by this director. 
Yes I think his frustrations are very relatable in many aspects of life
I agree. I would feel the same way if I were constantly experiencing bad luck
Would you want to play "God" for a week? What would you do?
I probably wouldn't, only because that would be a lot of responsibility to take care of everything in the entire world. But I would like to eliminate suffering in people. What about you?
Same here. I would probably end up like Bruce and end up saying yes to everyones prayers since it would be so overwhelming
Do you think that was the best way for him to answer prayers through email?
I agree. I think the email system was less personal than how God would actually answer prayers in reality. However, at that point I'm sure he was overwhelmed. How would you answer everyone's prayers if you had to be God?
Maybe through some type of app which is more modern now.  Do you think Bruce and Grace made a good couple?
I think that the fact that they came back together and reconciled proves that they were always meant to be together. 
What do you think he learned the most about being God for the week?
I think he learned about true happiness and how much people need prayers and responses by God. I think that he now understands that importance of not complaining. 
Hey there!
yes
Have you seen the Shape of Water? It is an amazing movie 
hello
hi!
Is the movie any good?
have you watched 1975 thriller? by steven spielberg
it acutallly good
97% rating
on rotten tomatoes
A 1975 Steven Spielberg  movie??? is the movie jaws?
lol yes !
i thought it said thriller
thats the genre
but the movie is jaws
The movie is a thriller.When i watched for the first time, i was really scared
i acutally havent seen the full movie
do you recommend it?
The movie is really scary despite the fact the shark is only shown full body at the end.
thats cool 
he dies with a gas tank in his mouth right?
yes, with a big explosion
why you never watched the whole movie?
i never got too much into it but i remember  the ending
My favorite Spielberg movie is ET
did Spielberg do the Indiana Jones?
Yes, the whole series.Did you know Tom Selleck was supposed to be indiana jones?
i did not i wonder how that wouldve been.
can you imagine Indiana Jones not been played by Harrison Ford??
no i cant!
harrison ford is legend!
Yes, but is hard to believe he only became famous at 35 years old because of star wars
what did you think about the indiana jones movie with the aliens?
The last one??? It did not have the same charm.
yes! i felt the same way very different i had mixed feelings about it
Harrison was too old to play the character.
Have you seen a good movie lately at the theaters?
its been awhile since ive been to the movies 
but i did watch the hateful 8
just recently for the first time
it was really good
Yes, that was a good one.I love Tarantino movies
time to say goodbye,nice talking to you
Hi
Hi, give me a minute...
ok, I am here...
do you know movie The Post?
it' s historical political thriller...
do you like such films?
I have to watch it again... I love Maryl Streep...
Hi, are you still there?
yes..
do you know this film?
The Post?
I am not 'there' 
I am here :)
hellooo!
do you like movies of historical, political genre?
Do you like films produced by Steven  Spielberg?
do you like Tom Hanks?
or Meryl Streep?
I love a good superhero movie! Iron Man is a good one.
hello
have you seen the mmovie?
Hi!
I saw it many years ago
Yes, same!
And just recently as well. I really do enjoy Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man.
I can't believe it has been 10 years since it came out. That's crazy.
I know, it feels like cou ple years
I like Robert Downey too
Time flies. Haha. 
Would you watch it again?
Definitely!
Did you see it on the big screen the first time?
I normally do agree with Rotten Tomatoes scores. A 94 for this movie is pretty good.
I saw it on DVD but still was fun
Honestly... not sure! Ha!
I don't totally trust critics, they give biased reviews
Wasn't there a sequel  to this movie?
I don't totally trust them either. I never let reviews stop me from watching a film.
I think it is best to decide for yourself
I usually watch a movie if I like the actors
I believe there was an Iron man 2 and 3!
I forgot that Jeff bridges was in this cast!!
Likewise!!
I really did like the end of this movie. Especially when Tony Stark reveals his identity as Iron Man.
I don't remember details but the entire movie was enjoyable
As well as when Stark defeats Stane on top of his building.
You'll have to watch it again and refresh your memory!!!
I think I recall that
Yes, I do need to watch it again
maybe during spring break
Perfect! You can follow up with the sequels. Haha
it's one of those movies you can just pick up and watch any time
you don't really need to know the background
Definitely! Even for the sequels. Still enjoyable. Well, it's been nice chatting! Enjoy the rest of your day.
Hello.
Hello
 Lets talk about a movie from Steven Spielberg. :D
Yes ! 
The post seemed like a great movie I never got the chance to see it did you ?
I never got to watch it either my friend lol
Sometimes, Spielberg makes these movies that are not very adventure related... I love Spielbergs work if theyre going to be adventure movies.
Haha after reading this though I'm interested in seeing it
Lets see now.
I see you prefer adventure related movies instead of historical drama
I don't know, it feels like Bridge of Spies kind of vibe.
I mean I do like those types of movies but when it comes to Spielberg, you got to bring in the ADVENTURE.
Its supposed to be his trademark honestly.
Anyways yeah.
This seem to be a very interesting movie to say the least.
Haha I see he is a very versatile director though 
It does great cast behind it too
I have have an interest in the Vietnam war 
Well of course hahaha.
I have too!
The ratings for the movie seem appropriate for a Spielberg movie.
And how the soldiers were treated back home was terrible  
 I can't quite remember how the media portrayed them 
They do 
Very terrible...
I am not a fan of Meryl Streep though.
One of the greatest but just too perfect for me lol.
Yes :(
Me too! I mean I've never really seen her movies 
Hahaha
But she is heavily praised 
Yeah but when it comes to Oscars... SHE IS ALWAYS THERE. You can always see her... Old woman, give space to the youngins! hahahaha
Haha she's a legend 
That's what they say
Honestly though might watch the post after this 
Big tom hanks fan
Hahaha
I know.
Hey hey.
Im a big Tom Hanks fan too!!!
Haha I just went on a movie binge with his classics 
Remember in Saving private Ryan, Captain Miller saying "Earn this!" to a young Matt Damon... HAHAHAHAHA
That cracked me up honestly. It great acting but it sounded funny. Anyways, different movie haha. I would definitely watch this movie again.
I haven't seen private Ryan I need too I just became a big fan like 2 months ago 
SAY WHAAAAAT!
Watch both movies!
I will though because of you!
Anyways thanks and good bye! Habe a good one haha.
Next ?
Have*
Youre welcome haha.
Bye! You too!
Hi there!
Hello
how are you doing?
I'm good and you?
doing fine. so what do you want know?
Well we are talking about the movie Dunkirk it seems. I have never seen it but I have heard it is good. Have you seen it?
Yes I have and I enjoyed it
That's good. Was the movie fast paced?
In most moments yes.
Do you feel they relied too much on special effects though?
Not, it feels very real.
Who was your favorite character in the movie?
I really liked Alex
Why is that?
He was a complex character. Not straight up good guy or bad guy.
Do you feel the movie had a fitting ending or was it a cliffhanger?
As an historical drama there was little chance for a cliffhanger. So it ended well.
That's good. Do you feel that all the characters were well developed?
No. The "Gibson" character could have been better developed.
What about casting choices? Were the actors all pretty decent for their character roles?
They were, with some surprises like Harry Styles making the cast.
Do you feel they were pretty accurate with the props and clothing for the time period portrayed  since it was a historical drama? 
Yes. Not only in the military side, but also in regards to the characterization of civilian life.
What was your favorite part of the whole movie?
The scene where Tommy, Alex and Gibson hide inside a trawler.
okay
are you interested in watching the film?
Alex seems like a really cool character. Especially with all the realism described.
so yes I am interested
Hi
hello
I've seen this movie before
i have not i  heard it was good though
I like any movie that has leonardo dicaprio tho
Yes, it is hard to understand in the beginning but you get hooked later on
 Is it an action movie?
yes
it's a thriller/science fiction movie
oh ok.  
It sounds like a good movie. It sounds like it is a good monsters inc successor.
I agree. I'm slightly disappointed by the Rotten Tomatoes score. Then again, it is the first time that Pixar has made a prequel film. 
Do you typically watch movies like Monster's University?
Typically no since i generally like to watch anime. But if the franchise is one i watched when i was a kid. Then I usually will make a effort to see it.
And i agree those scores kinda seem rather low.
I understand. Just by glancing at the ratings, do you think you'd make an effort to go see the prequel? Or would the score discourage you from seeing the film?
Id still see it despite bad reviews. I generally like to decide things by myself to see if i like it or not. Like if 99% of people say its bad or good. I usually won't follow what i hear. I just go and experience it for myself. And then from there I usually say its cool or  say its bad.
Makes sense. I typically only pay attention to the ratings when it's a director who I am familiar with. If I know that their work is usually phenomenal and a particular movie has awful ratings, I usually will wait to hear from friends/family before paying to see it. 
Also im a fan of comedy movies. So I'll probably enjoy for the memes and jokes.
Ya same.
Comedy movies are always a must see in my book. 
And if im being honest, pixar usually makes good movies so I have good expectations. Illumination movies is what im " iffy" about.
I love that Monster's University has a fraternity involved. Even more so love it because they call it Roar Omega Roar.
Mike is 7???? What in the...I never knew that.
ya that name is great.
He's only seven when he goes on the field trip. He goes to college eleven years later. So he'd be eighteen.
I misread that at first too. 
ahhh I see well that clears that up.
Looks like this movie is pretty heavily based on cartoon fraternities. 
yep
I find it odd that Pixar has a scene in this movie where Sulley tampers with the machine to get better scores. Doesn't really promote the whole 'fair play' imagine to their age demographic. 
Oozma Kappa. I can't believe they threw a kappa meme in there.
Every movie with a fraternity/sorority always contains 'Kappa.' Ever notice that?
ya. Its pretty much a dead meme.
Am i slow for thinking hardscrabble was male until this passage? lol
Wonder what CDA stands for in this movie. Clearly, it's some form of an enforcer but what type of enforcer does a monster have? 
idk maybe to make sure they are scary enough.
Nope! I thought the same. I think it was because there was no gender context to go off of in the last paragraph. 
yeah probably.
Well it sounds like a safe movie for the kids.
No, I don't think it's to make sure they're scary enough... the CDA has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their expulsion from the university. 
Although i  expect a few hidden adult jokes cause college and fraternity makes me think they slip one or two in there.
Ah i see that would make sense.
I agree. I was skeptical about the cheating portion of the movie as that doesn't coincide  with a kids film and what you'd want to teach the kids at this age level but they do bring in negative reinforcers for the monster's actions,. 
True. Movies these days are getting so caught up in formulaic tropes that kids pick up on them.
I hope the movie stays fresh and a bit unpredictable.
Keep the kids on their toes.
One can only hope. 
And still be smart enough to let the parents enjoy it.
A 79% on a kids movie doesn't seem too bad in my opinion after reading the key scenes.
Thats why past pixar films in my opinion were so good. And still seem better than movies today.
Thats true. I think overall it sounds like a good movie.
Hello
Hello
Have you seen the movie Frozen?
Yes I have, I actually saw it in theatres with my Fiance at the time it came out.
Did you like it?
Yes, it is a funny animation film.
I agree. I saw it in theaters too
I enjoy almost anything that Disney produces
The critical response was pretty good I see. \
I heard they are making a second movie to follow Frozen
It only got an 89 percent on rotten tomatoes. I thought it would get a higher score.
I don't much care for review sites, I would rather watch a movie and judge it myself.
I agree with the CinemaScore of A+
Me too, I love the artwork and time that goes into animation and C.G. movies
It seems like this movie just came out. I cannot believe it was 2013 when it arrived in theaters. 
Yeah, so much attention and popularity has kept it alive in stores as toys, shows and other items.
Who is your favorite character in Frozen?
It either has to be Sven or Christophe
Kristoff*
Do you know who Kristen Bell is?
I know of her, but not familiar of her other acting jobs.
I like the villain. I thought he was funny.
Yeah, something was up when they fell for each other early in the movie between him and Anna
Olaf could be a bit much sometimes, but had some funny parts
Yeah, I did not even guess he would have been a bad guy
I think I called it during the movie and said something to my fiance about how redheads are always portrayed as badguys.
Good point. I didn't even think of that
He looks like the villian commander from the newer Star Wars movies.
What rating would you give the movie out of ten?
I think an 9, it was a great movie, even if the music is overplayed
Bye!
Hello
Hi
What is the name of the movie?
Batman v Superman. Have you watched it ?
No, I havent, is it good?
Are you still there?
It's better than Man of Steel, the superman movie
But well below Dark Knight.
Have you seen Zootopia?
No I haven't have you?
Yes, I have I found it to be quite entertaining. It's animated so it's more geared toward children.
Oh that's awesome. I like foxes and really like that it has a fox duo even though they are cons
I liked the scene when Cheif Bogo assigned her to parking duty, it is funny. Do you intend to see this movie in the future?
Ooops I did see it.. Sorry I misunderstoof/ was thinking about a different movie. My family thoroughly enjoyed Zootopia especially teaching that even a bunny can be a police officer! Very funny and inspiring movie!
That is quite alright, I really enjoyed it as well. I was laughing more than I'd care to admit. The foxes were also great. Do you agree with the ratings?
I always seem to get caught up in childrens movies especially when they are funny. Yeah I think the ratings were right on at 98% and 8/10!
I also have to agree, I thought it was an original way to teach kids about stereotypes.
Yes definitely! That is a good lessen for children to learn especially in this way!
What did you think about Otterton going "Savage"?
At that point in the movie, I wasn't really sure where they were headed but the mystery kept me watching.
Did you enjoy the animated depiction of the crime boss, Mr. Big?
Yeah I agree. It definitely took a few turns with that one! Yes I thought he was a great character! 
His limo was a very important part, don't you think?
The limo was a very important find for Judy Hopps.
What did you think the "night howlers" were?
Yeah I thought so too! I really didn't have a clue until they showed it! It was somehwat suspenseful for a childrens movie, don't you think?  
It had me on the edge of my seat, I also had no idea. 
Were you upset when Lionheart was arrested?
Yeah I didn't really like that part! 
Were you surprised about Judy and Nick teaming up?
I was very surprised that she was able to coerce him with her carrot pen.
I couldn't believe it was the flowers causing that effect! Did you see that coming?
User 2 left the chat 6 minutes ago with no response.
hey
so are we ready to talk about this movie?
Yes..
Ok well overall I thought this movie was pretty good.
Its very action movie, I like this movie so much 
yea, it actually does a nice job of giving all of the characters stuff to do and doesn't feel like to much is going on
Yes., Its all are done a good job..I Saw this movie in  4 times..
ive seen it quite a few times also
okay,,.who is director of the movie??
joss whedon
he doesn't do marvel movies now he's moved on
Okay thanks for your information..
no problem, i feel like this movie really launched chris hemsworth as a big deal 
Yes sure..Its really big deal on Chris hemsworth
i also think this movie has kind of served as a template for newer super hero movies
the all star cast really helped too 
not sure you could do a movie better than this one for this style
Yeah..but previous super hero acting is very well and adorable..
well all depends on the movie
this movie also may have done the best job out there on getting the hulk right
Yes..Hulk act is marvelous in this movie
it also does a nice job of making iron man a leader
overall just a really good display of the characters
Yes..Its all super heroes action equally displayed
yea it works out pretty well
i feel like this is kind of the super hero movie that does it all right
Yes.. really 
hopefully they keep getting it right
Yeah..when you watch this movie??
Hello
hi
The imitation game is a great movie
Hey, there's this movie called Bruce Almighty with Jim Carrey in it, have you seen it or would you like to?
I haven't seen it.
Have you seen it?
What's it about?
I have seen it, it's really funny. It's a comedy made in 2003 about a down on his luck tv reporter who complains to god and in return becomes god for a week
 I like comedies. Is Jim Carrey pretty good in it?
it is known as one of his best films, so I would say yes, it is very slapstick comedy
Is it also a romance?
no, it's a comedy
no it is not
Too bad. I like romantic comedies.
Does being God work out for him?
Hello
Hi, I just saw a movie
Oh what movie?
Mean Girls starring Lindsay Lohan
Was it good?
Well, I love High School movies for some reason. But this was exceptional. 
So it was a comedy?
Did it win any awards?
Yeah. Hilarious. It was written by Tina Fey, not to be mistaken for Sarah Palin.
Oh I love comedies, who else was in the movie?
i didn't recognize anyone else. Lindsay's always in the news, so I know her. 
Yeah she's in a lot of good movies
I dunno about awards, but I read that the critics loved it.
Nice, I'm looking for a good movie to watch, do  you recommend this one?
Yeah, but she's also famous for real life stuff...wild personal life. Sounds like she'll be POTUS one day
I'd recommend it. Besides being a teen movie, its a great conversational flick
she seems just like all the other young actresses
so is it suitable to watch with children do you think?
or do you think it'd be better for a date night movie
There's some dark comedy involved. At one point, one of the Mean Girls is struck by a bus. So more date night than family one. 
oh that sounds traumatic
are there any scary parts?
i'm a total wuss
Regarding awards, it is listed by Rotten Tomatoes as one of the Top 50 Teen Comedies.
No scary parts. Don't worry.
wow so it should be a good time then
is there anything else i should know?
i'm not a fan of gross out humor
Yeah, its an intelligent take on the genre. Seems to kinda make fun of it too...ends with the Prom...though not like Carrie fyi, since ur a self-described wuss.
No, no gross-out humor. 
Here's what's interesting. It was based on a non-fiction book
oh i love movies based on books
It was based on a book that studied social cliques in high school and their psychological effects on girls. So Tina Fey took that and made it into a comedy. Very unique. 
sounds interesting
Jaws was such a good movie!
I agree. It was well made.
The scares were well timed.
I liked the soundtrack.
What was your favorite part?
I think it was utilizing a location like Amity Island. It made me feel as if the plot could happen anywhere.
Was the soundtrack your favorite part?
That makes sense. Yes, especially the part that it is so famous for. The sound they played whenever they wanted to increase the audience's fear and anxiety.
Just another affirmation that Spielberg knew what he was doing even in post-production.
Do you usually like this type of movie?
No doubt. He is very good at making movies. No, it is not my favorite kind. I am not much into jump scares. I like documentaries. How about you?
I like this type of movie around Halloween; otherwise, I enjoy action films.
That is understandable. Halloween is a good time to scare yourself. 
What did you think of the mayor's reaction to the shark attack?
I think it was greedy. I agree it is best not to panic the public, but putting people in danger out of greed is not okay.
Exactly, I thought it was neat to think of real world implications both fiscally and morally.
Of how to present this to the public.
Which in the end resulted in a shark-hunting frenzy
I like to think of those things too. I did not like that part. I think I would have liked it better if the shark was led out to sea, but most people would probably not enjoy a movie like that, not enough drama.
You are right on that.
It was nice to see characters such as Brody step up - though it took his son to go into shock in order to spur him to action.
I think Spielberg hit the nail on the head as far as portraying small town politics.
Yes. It was realistic, though I think much of it applies to politics of all types. 
Money seems to always be highest priority.
Unfortunately, true.
And sadly we do not get galvanized to action sometimes until tragedy strikes.
Have you seen other Spielberg movies?
Yes, he has his shining moments and some duds along the way. I feel that more of his movies fall into the former rather than latter category.
You?
I know I have and that his movies are usually really well made, but I cannot remember which movies are his. I am very bad at stuff like that.
I did not like the scuba part. I enjoy enjoy breathing .
 I usually am as well.
Sorry, for the typo.
No worries. Completely agree on breathing/ I would not be getting in the water even with a cage.
Well, thanks for sharing this conversation with me. It seems that our time has come to an end. I hope you have a wonderful morning, afternoon, night wherever you are.
You as well.
hello
Hi, Do you think  this movie earned its 92& rotten tomatoes rating?
Yes, I think it did, it was a great movie.  What do you think of Robert Downey Jr in that role?
Hey!
Hi have you seen Dunkirk?
No I haven't
What is it about?
Its a war movie directed by Christopher Nolan. Its an awesome film.
Oh cool, what war?
World  War II. It's intense. Not a lot of dialogue though.
Is it a long movie?
Its an hour and 46 minutes long but its so amazing you don't realize how long it is.
Oh that's not even that long
Are there any well-known actors in it?
No and the way it's filmed is very impressive as well.
Is it similar to any other movie?
Do you want to see it?
yeah, I like war movies
What year did the movie come out?
I was mistaken. Harry Styles is in this movie.
I didn't know he was an actor!
Is he any good?
It came out last year 2017.
Nice
I will have to see it!
Yes actually he's good. I was surprised
Did he have a big role in the movie?
Most definitely worth it. Like I said its intense so you are in for a ride.
yeah definitely 
So tell me more about the movie
He did. What's crazy is he auditioned and got the part and Nolan didn't know he was a famous singer.
No way, really?!
Its based on Dunkirk's evacuation during WWII.
Do you enjoy action movies?
Batman vs Superman
The director is Zack Snyder, 27% Rotten Tomatoes, 4.9/10.
Not very popular it seems
But the audiences liked it. It has a B cinema  score 
Yes
There is a huge divergence between proffession al critical opinion and regular movie goers
I've never seen it
I know the difference. 
I can't believe they used Ben Affleck as Batman
So it probably won't get any awards, but should have done well enough at the box office
It was a strange choice
Well it was made in 2016
I'm just guessing as to what it may have accomplished back then
Probably nothing with those scores
The box office  gross is more important than critics acceptance for these blockbuster type movies
I don't like how they made a whole new story line.
They ruined it for me
although critics can affect word of mouth to an extent
Batman as a billionaire
yeah right!
Isn't that what he always was?
But they make it the main focus.
Batman I know, was humble
The lack of intellectual development for the main characters was my problem. Especially concerning Lex Luthor
Have you seen this movie?
Yes I have
What was your favorite part?
Lex L uthor was the worse villain ever
You think?
This wasn't a memorable movie. It got me through a bucket of popcorn at the moment I was watching, but you forget about it soon after
hahaha
Did people know that they were super heroes? 
The best part was Wonder Woman action scenes  in the final act
I love Wonder Woman
Wonder Woman is the right name for her cause I always wonder why they took so long to get her into the movies
haha
I agree!!!!
I canât seem to see what the movie is
I can. Its a teen comedy with Lindsay Lohan called "Mean Girls"
Got good reviews on rotten tomatoes but a poor score on Metacritic
Genre not really my cup of tea.
you there?
hello hello hello is anybody out there?
im aborting conversation in 5 minutes
3 min
aborting
hello
what is the name of the movie?
hello
Did you watch 'The Post'?
No, i didnt
what genre is it?
it is 'Historical, Political'
directed by Steven Spielberg
oh. Does it have any actors that I might know of?
Maryl Stree 
Streep
Tom Hanks
is it a new movie?
yes, 2017
oh, I guess im a bit behind the times. has it been well received?
I think it's worth watching
do you want to know something about plot?
what type of "post" is it named after? whats the movie about?
yes please
The Post depicts the story of attempts by journalists at The Washington Post to publish the Pentagon Paers
Papers
oh. is that related to the vietnam war?
yes
is the movie about a government cover up?
the government always has something to hide ;)
isnt that the truth!
it sounds like a movie id enjoy
I think that this film is worth watching
is it a long show?
do you know the length?
I dont know the length
but probably about 1.30h as usual...
do you know if it has won any awards?
I don't know
well thanks for telling me about the post. :)
hi
HI
Zootopia have u see this movie
hello
looking for a movie to watch, have you seen any good ones?
There is this one I saw recently with Benedict Cumberbatch - I liked it but it was not accurate historically speaking... 
What was the name of the movie?
The Imitation Game
How inaccurate was it historically?
If You like historical movies like that I mean - Benedict was awesome btw
well quite
if you watched it as pure fiction was it worth siin?
seeing?
What he did - brake the enigma code - in this movie it said ONLY him did it by creating this deciphering machine - where in fact, he used algorithms of Polish Mathematicians  - google it.  
It wasn't "pure" fiction. It was just inaccurate, but yes, I liked it and
Very interesting, I will
Keira Knightley - I will watch anything with her ;
:)
i wiil watch it
Do You like historical movies like that ? re You British by any chance ?
yes, but i am not are you
I'm Polish :)  that's how I know these facts about that part in history ;)
interesting, i am italiian
Machine he build was actually VERY visually similar to the original one
they did a great job with that
I will google the history
that is cool,
the machine was working a little bit different though - it was based on mathematical algorithms and not really "words" recognition. they made it look "easy" for the hollywood ;)
is it attention grapping
that is hollywood 
they do that often
big part of this is drama and action - MI6 agents involved in this whole operation etc. I think You would like it
i definitely am thinking about seeingit
I think they overestimated British role in that time... just saying ;)
that's why I asked You if You were British :) I didn't want to offend You
i wont hold it to be fctual  
Hello. Did you see the movie How to Train Your Dragon?  It was so cute!
Yes, I didn't know there were so many people in it.
I know the cast is great!  I am a big fan of Gerard Butler
He's really good.  Craig Ferguson is always good for a chuckle.
Yes. The movie wasn't all fun and games though.  It was kind of a dramedy with a little bit of seriousness to it.
Did you know America Ferrera was one of the voices?
I did not.  She play Astrid, Right?
Yes.  She's another student.
The 3-D animation was top notch.
I agree.  Dreamworks Animation is always on top of their game.
The critics  seem to agree.
The scene where Hiccup shoots the dragon down is kind of sad.
Lets it go though.
Yes.  Hiccups inventions are always going awry.
I was just thinking he pretty smart though, coming up with stuff being 15.
I agree.  Very imaginative.
I've gotta say it though.  Some of the names make me laugh.  Hiccup, Stoick the Vast, Gobber
I know they are too funny.  Hiccup is a great nickname though.
Did your description just go away?  Mine did.
Nope, I'm a slow reader though.
No worries.
So you can't read the bit about a Caudal fin.  That's bit of toothless that tore off.
I can't see it, but I remember.  Poor toothless.
I've got to google that.  I really do love this movie.  98% it's nice to know I like a movie others do to.
Yes.  That is a really high rating.  It has a great harmonious message at the end which is inspiring
Reckon we're supposed to keep going.  Stoick straps toothless to the ship and goes off to fight the mega-dragon.  I've kind of felt that this was an old trope, but still works a bit.
I think we have to remember that is is for kids.  The fight scenes are really done well.
You're right.  That first critic says something about the areal battles being too much, but honestly I loved them.  I'm a grown man but still a kid at heart.
Aerial* sry
I agree.  The critics need to remember the child within.
I knew what you meant.
The finish conversation button came up.  Have a great afternoon!
You too.
Hello
Hi 
have you watched the movie?
When it first came out. It has been a while 
did you see it? 
same for me
it has been a while
did you like it
I thought it was a really cool concept for a movie. My kids loved it. 
Did you like it? 
yeah, it was ok at the time
what do you think of that last bullet point?
Rokie with robots?
lol, I found that funny, Rocky with robots 
I would not have compared this to a classic like Rocky 
yeah me too, I think it is funny
i know
but the movie does feel like that
the other bullet point says, it better a cliche
I can see some thing mixing. the human strugle 
now I rember it better where hugh jackman fights the bull in the beginning  
the next to last bullet point is funny, "Though the premise of fighting robots does seem a plausible and intriguing extension of the contemporary WWE world. reminds of Robots VS wrestlers in How I Met Your Mother  episdoes 
probably that was funny
That was funny fight, watching a robot fight a bull 
yeah that is funny
I thought the robot would win, lol 
the bull was the real rocky
lol
yes he was 
I did also like the little robot knocking out the big zeus 
yeah, it had too
it has such a bad rating though
59%
I was looking at that. the other  is a 56 out of a 100
probably it is those expert reviews cause the last one it gives an A
cinemaScore
guess it depends on the person, the mood they are in when they watch it. I liked the experts better 
the experts liked it, lol 
nice talking to you
bye
same, nice talking to you as well 
later 
hey partner
hey partner
hey
I like the movie, about about you?
I think this is one of Scorcese's best modern movies
I agree
Great casting 
Who's your favorite character?
Leo for sure
Incredible performance
What about you?
I'd have to agree, but Jonah Hill really knocked it out of the park in his supporting role
True. It was very different from his previous work
That middle critics review...what were they watching
I heard he took a huge pay cut just to be in it.  
Yeah I don't really agree with those reviews
Anyone who thinks this glorified his life did not really pay attention lol
Haha yeah
I really liked Matthew McConaughey in his little part too
I was just going to say that
The chest thumping scene might be my favorite part of the movie
Yeah it was so weird yet so brilliant
He was the only one who could have done that role IMO
I think that of many of his roles
That phone call is one my favorite scenes as well
Where he does the demonstration
Hahaha yeah and the "sell me this pen" bit at the diner
It was a great way to introduce all those weird characters
Nerdiest looking team 
I think this was first movie i saw with margot robbie
Yeah I think this was her biggest role up until that point
I thought she would just be a pretty face but she's actually a great actress 
Probably her best too because other than like I,Tanya, she hasn't been in anything else that good
Yeah she's really good
Yeah I saw I, Tonya..loved it
I think she got nominated for that right?
I think she did for a few awards
Allison Janney got alot more nominations 
Speaking of awards I cannot believe that Leo didn't win an oscar for this
Yeah, i totally thought this would be the one
The Revenant was good but he said maybe 10 lines in the whole 2 hour and 45 minute movie
Oh really? I havent seen that movie yet
compared to this one where he said something every scene
That one is really good but its really visual 
Gotcha
and there's not a lot of dialogue so it's one of those movies you have to be ready to watch lol
Yeah, that's really why i havent watched it
Hello.
Hi, have you seen the John Wick movies?
I have seen the first one but I have not seen the second one.
The next one is great where he goes after his car that was stolen.
That sounds interesting.  I will make plans to the see the 2nd John Wick movie.  What was the topic of the movie that you read about?
He was seeking revenge for the theft of his car and the killing of his puppy.
What person was he seeking revenge against?
Losef the son of the head of the Tarasov syndicate, took the Mustang to Aurello's shop to get the VIN number changed and Aurello kicks him out of the shop and tells John.
How did John go about getting his revenge?
John wanted to retire but was drawn back in to get revenge.
Does John get any help getting his revenge?
John visited Aurello who tells him Losef  is the son of  Viggo.
Who is Viggo?
 John learns that Losef is at the Night club from Winston of the Continental, he prepares to get Losef. He is the son of Viggo who is the head of the Russian syndicate in New York.
Why doesn't Viggo just give Losef to John?
John travels to little Russia where Viggo has a church front. He destroys the cache of money and blackmail making material,
Losef is his son and does not want Jon to kill him.
Why doesn't Viggo just pay for John's new car and buy him a new dog to save his son?
They tried to kill John so he was after the whole sindicate and raced to the Helicopter that Viggo was trying to escape in.
I think this is the one you saw.
I don't remember much of the plot from the first movie.  I do remember John Wick  killing everyone in bullet filled ballet.
I loved the end where he takes out Viggo being stabbed. He then goes to a Veterinarian and treats his self and takes a pit bull puppy scheduled to be euthanized.  
I do remember that part.  I enjoyed the ending of the movie.
The part where he walks home along the boardwalk with the puppy and rembers that is where he had his last date with Helen.
Who is Helen?
She was his wife that died.
How did she die?
Hello how are you? How did you like the movie Iron Man? 
I havent watched that movie.
Have you?
Well I think Robert Downey Jr. did a great job!
I'd say it was one of the best super hero films
Hey
I had no idea this movie was actually based on a self-help book
Hi. Oh wow. That is an interesting fact
yeah
love this movie lol. i've watched it so many times, it never gets old.
the social commentary is too funny
Well not a big fan of Lindsay Lohan but I think the movie was fun
Love Tina Fey and Amy Poehler
I can't believe this movie is already over a decade old though. Yeah Tina Fey wrote the screenplay but not sure what Amy Poehler did?
Yeah it's so crazy haha. makes you feel old
Amy Poehler was Regina George's mom
The document doesn't say this so I can't be sure
Quite decent ratings and reviews! 
yeah she's not a main character
yeah definitely
(we shouldn't talk about anything not mentioned in the document)
oh yeah. 
i thought that would be relevant to the movie haha but yeah let's be safe
Scene 1 is hilarious
The descriptions of the Plastics are really funny
That was funny the "plastics"
And the queen bee Regina George. Haha. 
haha
The wording of scene 2 is funny as well. I like how they wrote this, it captures the essence of the movie.
So much drama between high school girls. Well it's not unusual high school students have drama but they kicked it up a notch 
Haha yeah definitely
It seems so silly which makes it funny
satirical
I think it's so funny that Regina casually breaks her spine and is hit by a bus
Well the principal.. When I was watching the movie, I felt for him.. don't wanna be in his position
Hahah yeah definitely
Ms. Norbury handled this well
And Ms. Norbury and others... it must have been a headache
I like that Cady becomes her old self again in scene 3
It makes high school drama seem like a "phase"
And here comes Aaron! Finally a boy enters the scene. Remember the tension when we watched?
Haha yeah!
I'm proud of her for reconciling with her friends and becoming elected Prom Queen, which shows her character development
Yes. Very nice of her.
Nice touch when she said "her classmates are wonderful in their own way"
I'd say that was very mature of her
I agree. I love that she's promoting acceptance and tolerance.
It's a nice way to end the film.
I think we're done!
Yes! thanks! it was nice talking to you
Hello.
Hi, I think you should watch LaLa Land. It sounds like it is an amazing movie
Who stars in the movie?
Ryan Gosling, Emma stone, and John Legend
I like Ryan Gosling. He is a good actor, but I heard that it was a musical. Is that correct?
Yes, it is a musical romatic comedy! It has the best off all the things that make you feel good! Romance,and comedy.
I cannot imagine Ryan Gosling in a musical, but I guess it could work.
Where does the movie take place?
He plays as the Jazz pianist, and he falls in love with Emma Stone. It takes place in Los Angeles. 
Is Emma Stone playing an artist also?
She is a aspiting actress in this film. They are both pursuing their dreams. 
What part does John Legend play?
I am not sure what part he pays. In the first part Ryan Gosling is at a party and he plays a cover of I Ran (So far Away), he feels like the song is an isult for a serious musician
What is the time period of the movie? Is it a modern story?
Yes I think it is modern time period
Have you seen the movie?
No I have not seen it yet, I want to though. I want to know if they stay together or they have a struggle with their relationship
Relationships are tough. I wonder how the two characters handle theirs.
Emma who plays Mia, writes her own one women play. That sound interesting! Ryan who is playing Sebastian is performing regualry at a club and they move in together. I am thinking they sound like a fun couple.
Do you know what the play is about?
No, sadly I do not know what it is about. I do know that Sebastian does not enjoy the music his band plays in 
Is there alot of dancing also?
I am not sure on that, but I would think there is. Sounds like it is filled with music! I love a good musical
I do too, if it is done well.
Does Emma Stone sing as well?
When their band has the first tour Mis and Sebastian get into an argument! He thinks she wants him to be unsuccessful
That doesn't bode well for the relationship.
I think she is just an aspiring actress, not a singer. He misses her first play where noone shows up, and she owes the theater money and moves to Nevada since she can not pay. Getting very interesting!
Does he go with her to Nevada?
No, she is mad and not forgiving him for missing her play. Her first play sounds like it was a bust
It sounds like it. Writing plays must be difficult. Sounds like she took it hard.
John Legend plays Keith, he is a band member. I bet hes a great bank member!
I bet you are right.
I am sure she just did not have enough experience for the play writing and how to execute the play and promote it. 
Well, this sounds like an interesting movie. Thanks for all the information.
I do hope you will see it. I want to see how the realtionship plays out during the film. 
Sounds great.
Helllo
Hi, there.
I guess we are to talk about the movie
Have you seen it
Yeah - I wanted to talk about it because I like how David Fincher directed it. 
ok
Did you see it?
did you enjoy it
yes i did
Yeah, a lot. Sorkin and Fincher sure laced their scathing wit with an aching sadness, you know? I guess everybody says that, though.
ok, i wasnt aware it was based on a book
Yeah. Though I guess the movie isn't quite as factual as the book? And that the book is pretty heavily debated.
I see
You remember that bit where Zuckerberg gets dumped and then writes a mean post about his ex?
Im not a fan of facebook or zukerbeg, but I thought the movie was well done.   I dont remember that part specifically
Yeah, no, I'm no fan of either, either. But it was that scene that kind said everything that needed to be said about the mentality behind that site. I thought that was pretty brilliant. 
it seems to be highly rated
Yeah. It's definitely a strong movie. I mean, it's a movie about Facebook that is actually watchable. That's saying something.
yes Iwas thinking that as well
it is even more trajic where it has brought us politically
For sure. And I feel like it's all in that bit where Sean Parker has his line about "You know what IS cool? A billion dollars." Like, it's presented as a way to keep people in touch, but it's really the coldest corporate-type of thing.
yes greed is powerfull
Did you know Sean Parker was the founder of Napster?
yes
it is interesting how he suggested getting rid of "the"
Yes! I was just about to say that.  I think it's crazy how much influence he had on Facebook when it started out.
Then there's that last scene, where Zuckerberg keeps refreshing his page to see if his ex-girlfriend has accepted his friend request. That's what it all comes back to. After all the greed, you've still got these human needs.
it is interesting for sure
it would be funny if it was still called f acemash
I know, that was a pretty weird name. Even 'Facebook' seemed weird back in the day.
i think it is a dangerous false reality that has changed humanity for  the worse
millions are addicted to it, and it is proven to shape perceptions in false ways
Yeah, I think so, too. Though I also think there is a natural balance of humanity and that at some point Facebook will be left in the dust. Or at least it's worst aspects will be. Again, I just think about that last scene. Maybe it's too optimistic, but I think people will abandon Facebook. Maybe not this generation, but the next.
Was there anything you didn't like about the movie?
it seems to be in that direction to some point already.  a lot of damage has been done though
I think we are done now, have a good day
Okay, You too!
Hi. Just looking at this now.
Hola, ando leyendo
Who played Hawkeye?

I liked the movie because of the mission you mention. Did you like it?
I'm just reading about it
Ok
I'm really interesting and it's a classic
I guess a wormhole opened to let Loki through to the Earth.
The wormhole is called aTesseract. That's hard to say and spell.
that hole that he found was quite exciting
A movie critic said the the Hulk was played like he was a reservoir of calm but then became a Volcano. I agree.
143 minutes for a movie is long these days
are you there and reading the document. Tell me about your impression of how long the movie is please
i understand

just i lose my conexion
Hello
Hello
Are familiar with the movie The notebook?
I have heard about it but have not seen it
What is it about?
Its a romance movie based on the 1996 novel with the same title by Nicholas Sparks
Who are some of the actors in the film?
Ryan Gosling as the main actor and Rachel McAdams
Interesting. I'm a fan of his work, what are your thoughts on the movie?
I actually cried when I first watch it. It is awesome. Got 52 percent in rotten tomatoes but I will give it a 100 
Really? Would you say it resembles the book well?
There are some changes but pretty much. I only care about the ending anyway. Ryan Gosling play as Noah in the movie, he is poor while Allie is from a rich family and she is engage with someone else but fell in love with Noah 
Oh wow that seems really interesting. I will have to check it out for sure. Do you know if its available on netflix?  
Hmm not sure. It was released year 2004 so it probably is
Ahhh okay, So based on what you know about the movie are their cheesy or cliche elements portrayed in the film?
not at all but that is for me. it is heart touching and will make you cry. if made me cry. Allie got Alzheimer and she doesn't remember Noah but he still visits her everyday and they died together   
omg!!! thats so crazy honestly kind of excited to see this movie now 
Yes, its an art, love the book but I love the movie more
Thats how i felt with the fault in our stars. Great book but movie was incredible.
When he enlisted in the army he writes to her everyday but her mom intercept the letters so she was devastated for a year
I love that movie too!
Damn so this movie is like a mix of saving private Ryan, me before you, and possible other movies
Somewhat but much better. I don't know why it got low rating, it is one of my favorite movie
I mean rotten tomato is pretty picky on certain movies which i dont get cause some films are brilliant but do not get the credit they deserve
I know. It probably on personal preference. Others might not like it
Side track how long is this task suppose to be?
But i agree that its a personal preference
Not sure but we have to talk about the movie till we can click the finished conversation button 
Are you familiar with the director? Nick Cassavetes
i am not
what are some of his other movies?
Hi
Hi.  It told me to read this page first so I'll be just a minute.
Okay done reading.  Is anyone there?
Welp I hope I still get paid for this because I read the directions, read the movie description and am waiting here to chat I was directed to do.
The other person back out I am still here wasting my time so I hope that whoever checks this over is willing to pay me for holding up my end of the bargin.  Aborting conversation in a min if yall don't send me someone new to chat with.
Other participant left the conversation early.  
Hi, how are you?
Good how about you
Have you ever seen jaws?
No I haven't. Is it good?
It is amazing. It's about a man trying to save his beach side town from a crazy shark
What about LA LA land? Have you seen that?
Would you say it has a happy ending to it?
I haven't seen LA LA land either. Which one would you recommend?
Yes. They kill the Shark and get to relax and be happy in the end
Aw man, spoilers haha
Honestly I would recommend jaws. It's such a great classic movie
Why not La La land? Do you not like it?
What genre is La La land? 
LA LA land is OK but it doesn't compare to the action of Jews. I give it a 7.8 whereas jaws is a 9.1
LA LA land is a musical romantic Comedy
Hmm, you might have to convince me a little more about Jaws just because I already know the ending. Since you said LA LA Land is a romantic comedy, is there any romance in Jaws?
And is LA LA Land based on a real story?
No. Jaws has little romance
Hello?
great movie, isnt it?
What movie are you talking about?
Monsters  University
Ah right, I've heard it is good. What did you like about it?
for sure i didnt whatch it. But According to the article It was realised by  Pixar
Did it get better reviews than the original Monsters Inc?
can you be more specific?
Monsters University is a sequel, I wondered if it is better than the first movie
unfortunately i didnt what the first
and I didnt know it was a sequel
Ok then... Does the article have any more information that you can tell me?
the critics say it a colorful movie
can you tell me what you think about that
Does it say it is suitable for children?
I haven't seen the movie yet, I'm trying to decide if I should watch it
Is it a family movie?
Oh okay
I think so
I wonder if my 4 year old would enjoy it? Maybe he's too young?
If it's colorful and funny I think he will enjoy it. Did the article say it was a funny movie too?
May be you would be afraid, because its  a monster movie
Oh is it a scary movie?
its a comedy animation so yes it is a funny movie
Phew! That sounds great then, he loves comedy animation movies. I think we'll watch it together
great
Do you know when it is released?
Or is it already on DVD?
it was realed by 2013
 so I think it is already in DVD
It might even be on Netflix already! I will check tonight!
Thanks for your help :)
Theres no problem
Have you seen this movie?
I just saw it.
Have you seen it?
No, I usually like stuff with Benedict Cumberpatch though.
It was such a thrilling movie. Based on the life of Alan Turing.
Keira Knightly slightly annoys me however.
Cumberbach was really the highlight of the film
Got good reviews, Rotten tomatoes rarely goes over 90% it seems.
Who is Alan Turing?
true. Metacritic gave them 73/100. Turing was a mathematician who was a cryptanalyst for the British during WWII against the Germans. He is famous for breaking the Enigma code.
He was outed as a spy by the police who were investigating a break in at his home.
Definitely see it if you get a chance.
Dramas tend to kind of bore me usually, with many note-worthy exceptions. I like Comedies mostly or fantasy, Sci-fi. I will check it out though, all in all i just love movies!
Sounds like an interesting fellow, will definetly give it a watch.
It is really more of an espionage movie. It is pretty exciting. I guess there is some drama with his experiences in boarding school and studying with Morcom, his mentor.
I think you will enjoy it.
Morton Tyldum is a great director.
Andrew grant and that rag science news never gets it right, if he liked it i will probably hate it.
The hollywood reporter seems to be as fond of Cumberpatch as i am.
It is kind of technical. It goes pretty in depth about his machine to break the code. He has some breakthroughs when he realizes he can program it with words he already knows. You will probably enjoy that.
Cumberbach does a great job acting.
These storys based on true stories tend to always add so much stuff to keep it interesting that it kinda distorts history in my opinion.
The bit about getting married to Keira Knightley might be annoying for you if you are not partial to her acting. I might warn you about all that.
It is interesting since the movie is based on a play based on a book based on his life. I see your point there.
I would probably enjoy the technical aspects of the film, the good acting, and even the half made up story!
I think also where it is a movie about a mathematician, it kind of helps to add in some plot elements. I think this is unusual though as his life was so interesting.
There is quite a bit of espionage involved as well. I suppose I am not spoiling it since it is history, but there is some Russian collusion involved.
If he marries Keira knightly i may be shouting at my T.V.
Big drama when Turing confronts the russians.
Yeah you might have to fast forward through the lurid romance. It is not so bad though.
She is trite, absolutely, but the director does make it work here.
also, turns out he is gay!
so she gets what she deserves.
you might actualy like it.
I didn't really get that part, but who can understand the gays?
Well, that kinda of makes it more inviting to me, Keira Nightly must be sad to find that out!
yeah I think she was pretty upset. Like I said I didn't really understand all of that. I was mostly in it for the math. What an interesting, fascinating story.
I think Turing was gay for his mentor or something, but he dies.
Sounds a bit like Beautiful mind that was a great movie, too!
Tuberculosis.
Yeah I did love Beautiful mind. I read that that guy actually was working for the government.
Talk about changing the story!
Turing's story is pretty sad. He got bullied a lot at boarding school. Seems to have affected him a lot. Too bad he wasn't able to find love. Maybe he should have gone for somebody besides Kiera Knightley!
How come you dislike her so much?
Is it because you guys used to date?
Mostly just for hogging that driftwood in Titanic ;)
Oh yeah. I have never seen that one. 
I find her Wiry, trite, and egotistical. I only enjoy those qualities in myself.
I know there is that song by celine dion.
haha that is funny. I figured that but didn't want to say.
She is kind of a walking plattitude. Kind of like Reese Witherspoon, but more indiana less texas
or something
Oh, its ok. Im not blind. However after looking at Keira Knightley for 2 hours i might be.
Still the story sounds like one of importance that should be told, ill have to tune in.
anyways she didn't ruin the movie. If anything, Turing's life ruins the movie. It's just sad he gets bullied and takes refuge in gay love. He could have just worked out, made some friends, and been happy. It is a very important story. Reminds me of the life of Charles Darwin, or Plato.
oh, I really like Reese, Not sure what that says about me.
That is funny but you don't like Kiera. 
I thought Cumberbach made a great Turing, but it would have been funnier if they cast eminem.
Fitness is very important. Im a big fan of Darwin so that makes me interested a bit more in the story.
Well, Darwin had a rough time on the beagle. He was the captain's special steward, which was a demanding job, if you know what I mean.
All of the Hollywood rags seemed to speak highly of it.
His theory of fitness was basically an analogy for his relationship to the captain and his station in life, and his feeling of evolution to a higher station in his own life. He was certainly an interesting fellow.
I seriously loved this Turing movie. You have to see it!!!
I dont usually take anything the Hollywood reporter says to heart though.
No they have their own problems. 
And what do they know about science?
Not since they gave The Big Lebowski such awful reviews.
Turing is an important guy. I'd rather see a movie about Kurt Godel or Giordano Bruno.
Or maybe a serious horror/drama about Galileo.
I think the Big Lebowski was a great film I didn't realize it had a poor critical reception.
I actually think I might write a script about the life of Galileo
Your right, because Scientifically The Big Lebowski is the best movie ever made. yet, magazines like empire and Variety pee'd on its rug.
people would love that it would make them feel smart.
actually, that makes sense.
I am actually ordained as a Dudist Priest.
You can do it online for free, and then you can legally marry people.
Go forth and Abide my son.
Indeed. I shall Abide.
oh i know, im also a member dude.
Oh nice. I knew you were coolio foolio.
there is a fun facebook page too, dudeism, check it out!
What is up with this study though? I feel we are being watched. Do you think we will be in a movie with Benjamin Cumberbach?
I will for sure check it out on the myface.
I think there should be parallel networks called myface and spacebook.
haha i use that term Myface all the time.
great minds think alike.
I once toyed with the idea of opening a coffee shop called dunkin buckstar's
but yes, they say iron knows iron
It said there would be three pages, yet we seem to be done.
anyways though, it is pretty exciting to see Turing recalibrate that machine. You will enjoy that.
did you leave?
I didn't know Billy Crystal was the voice of Mike but I love it!
Steve  Buscemi is in this too?
Yes he is! I'm guessing you've seen Monsters University?
I did when it came out years ago, just never thought to look at the voice acting.
When did you see it?
Hello!
Hello so the movie we will be talking about is Batman V. Superman
Great! I haven't actually seen that yet, but have been really wanting to. Which actors play Batman and Superman?
The actors are really great and you probably know all of them. Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, and Jesse Eisenberg to name a few.
Oh, that is a great cast? Henry Cavill played Superman in the latest Superman film right?
Sorry, a great cast!
I am not sure but the film is still a part of the DC extended universe. Also it will be featuring wonder woman.
Ooh, that is excellent. I am looking forward to seeing Wonder Woman! Are Batman and Superman enemies at the start of the film?
Well lex luthor manipulates batman into a battle with Superman because he is obssessed with cloning superman.
Oh! So Batman is supposed to bring Superman to Lex Luthor?
No that is not the case however he is manipulated into helping. By the way did I mention this is going to be the first time batman and superman are in a movie together?
Really? The first time? That seems pretty amazing knowing that the characters have been around for so long! Very cool. Is the story set in Metropolis or Gotham?
The film appears to take place in both cities, and Batman comes to view Superman as a threat to humanity.
That is interesting, to have the film set in both cities. So Batman sees it as his duty somewhat to take Superman down?
Well the relationships of the characters are quite complex because Clark Kent A.K.A. Superman learns of Batman's justice methods and tries to expose him. All this happening while Lex luthor makes moves to get approval to obtain kryptonite from a senator.
Interesting. And so, I imagine Lois Lane is in this story? If so, does she serve a greater purpose? Does she know both superheroes?
Maybe but I am not sure. By the way do you usually care about reviews?
I will often read reviews to see what people have to say, but I don't change my mind about wanting to see a movie based on reviews. I think that I can't really know unless I see for myself. Do you care about reviews?
Not usually I like to be my own judge however if the reviews are overwhelmingly bad or good then it may influence whether or not I watch in theatres. I have to say for this movies though the reviews are quite mixed. 
Did you enjoy this film?
I did. I really liked seeing the scenes where batman manages to subdue the superman.
Cool. I guess that's one of the ultimate questions, which one could beat out the other. Do they team up at all in the film ?
Yes in Batman chooses to save Supermans mother while Superman confonts Lex.
Oh wow! The pairing of Batman and Superman's mom is a really cool part of the story, heartwarming.
I know but the film ends with sadly the death of Superman.
Oh wow! I am surprised by that, I thought they would keep their story line going for another movie or two. 
Dont worry the dirt on top of the coffin vibrates a nice wink from the Director.
Haha! That's the closing shot?!
I believe so it is in the last scene.
Awesome! Take care.
Hello
have you ever seen this movie
hello
I don't think that I have
have you?
No. i vaguely remember a book tho like from school time?
I do too!!
I thought it was a movie back then, so maybe this is a remake of that
I think so too because I saw 2013 and was like ummmm I thought it was older than that. 
I do like Leonardo DiCaprio though, so I should watch it!
oh yeah, i see them mention the book in the document which is really old
He sure is in a lot of movies
ya he is!
i definitely would check this movie out. I think i recalled that i liked the book- but wow that was like 20 years ago lol
hahaha not nearly 20 for me but close!!!
it doesn't have a very good rating with rotten tomatoes
sort of low rating scores tho
theyre kinda tough though!
very
yeah i was just checking that out- maybe it's not that good
yes that is true they are very hard on their ratings
maybe not. I'd still check it out though. 
The story seems interesting.
i dont know any of the other casts, i dont think
Tobey Maguire plays Spiderman I think
id definitely be willing to check it out.  the name is a classic.
oh okay i would know that character then
I wonder if it's on Netflix
i was just thinking that too
i would watch it for sure if it was there
i have prime too so i could chk there too.  we can also find trailer online too
me too! I"m gonna have to check it out once I get off of here. 
oooh yes, me too!
thats a good idea!
i love finding new movies to see
I don't see a paragraph about a movie. Is anyone else in here?
Hi! Have you seen the movie The Imitation Game?
I haven't. What's that about?
It's a 2014 American historical drama about real life cryptoanalyst Alan Turing.
Do you like biopics? If you do this movie might interest you.
It sounds interesting. What does Alan Turing do?
He decrypted German Intelligence codes for the British government during WWII. 
It has 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and average 7.7/10 and a Metacritic Score of 73/100. What ratings does a movie have to have for you to watch it? Or do you not consider ratings when deciding to watcha movie?
hey
hello
where would you like to start?
user 2 left the convo 
Dude 
what's good?
hey
you told me you would review a movie with me the last time we talked 
so you have my full attention 
bring it on
Have you seen batman vs superman?
Nope 
why not?
but I almost saw the trailer sometimes back
Maybe because i don't fancy them
so what's up with the movie?
Haven't you heard that it is a great movie?
Yeah, I hear that too often
I guess it is a Sci-Fi genre right?
not really
so what genre does it belong?
It's more of a fantasy, you should go see it it, it is action packed.
WHAT IS THE GENRE?
fantasy
remind me the director's name please, 
Is there a particular reason you have not seen it yet?
No not any
can you give me a run down of the cast?
why? Why didn't the tr ailer interest you?
hi
:)
heyy
this is my first time i just joined turk not sure how this works
its ok, we just chat right now and answer questions about the article we read
i havent been a turk worker very long either 
the page to the left
?
my friend sent me here 
Have you seen the movie Home Alone? that is what the article on the left is about
she says its decent she made 4 something her first month 
i was glad it was about a movie i have seen...lol
she cracked out on it tho lol
i dont see an article
i see like a thing saying what its about and whos in it 
of course ive seen it lol
who hasnt its so old
i picked this one bc its so easy ive seen it so many times 
i knew 2 of them i forget the other one tho 
On the left side there is an article and it is all about the movie Home Alone, after you read it we are supposed to discuss it , i think
2 of what ?
It was such a funny movie 
You should try to discuss the new paragraph when the document has changed. You will have 3 turns of conversation with your partner on each of the documents. You will be given 4 documents each containing a short paragraph. The new paragraph might show just beneath the previous document. The next document will be loaded automatically after you finish 3 turns discussing the current document. You cannot use information you personally know that is not included there. You can use any information given in the document in the conversation.
oh, i only see one document on home alone 
we messed up we only get 3 replies each page.... i think it was an epic movie! lol kevin is my fav character and i think its not fair to call it adult bashing that sounds like a response from a parent whos kid beats their ass lol at the bottom click tasks thats where i found that 
john hughes was the director , right ?
i didnt like the adult bashing comment either, i didnt see that. they were robbers
scroll to the bottom of the document... and at the bottom of this chat box it says tasks.... we get 3 chat responses each page we are shown.... 
ooohhh
see u said ohhh but u didnt add something about the movie.. u wasnted your response lol i hope we still get paid ;lollol side note the mcallister family missed their wake up call bc th epower went out i never caught that in the movie. 
Did you agree with the rotten tomatoes rating of the movie?
not at all. id give the movie a 10/10 its something i was raised on lol my mom used to put it on to shut me up
the document says its not realistic bc kevin would need tons of money to set those traps... i think thats bs.. his family DOES have money lollolol everything he used he had laying around his parents giant house 
Right, i did not agree that they were traps that any 8 year old could come up with. not at all in my opinion
Did you like that the movie had a Christmas theme?
i also like the scene where Kevin slaps his cheeks with the after shave and then screams because it was so unexpected and hilarious
thats true. i dont think an 8 year old would come up with those but i dont think he would have "needed his own money" either i think xmas was perfect they were traveling for the holidays.. i prefer the other one tho where hes stuck in NYC 
home alone is a 1990 film! i was born in 1990 lol NOW I FEEL OLD 
lol....yes home alone is a 1990 film and i was 15
 Kate discovers mid-flight that Kevin is missing, how stupid llolol made for a funny movie but how can you forget a kid at home lol 
I know...i was just thinking about that too, how they had to rush around in the movie because they overslept, and then just counted heads and thought they had kevin. i cant imagine having that many kids that i could ever forget one 
you were 15 lollollol omg i was born in feb of 1990 -with two would-be burglars played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. i think they were perfect for the part! hysterical 
i was just about to say something about the actors who played the burglars....i really enjoyed Joe Pesci character in the movie. 
i do not agree that the first half was flat either. i think it was a great movie from beginning to end 
lol you leeeeft me 
The movie is Toy Story.
From 1995, director is John Lasseler, 100% rotten tomatoes, 9/10 score.
Hello, have you seen Toy Story? I did. I Agree with the critical that is has the purity and ecstatic freedom of imagination. What do you think?
I agree, it was a very popular movie.
I love animations and Pixar is amazing. This one was really perfect. As it was mentioned a work of genius.
I also love Pixar
Maybe they'll make another Toy Story movie.
The interaction between Woody and Buzz is really nice. Also hearing Tom Hanks as Wood is incredible.
Oh yeah, classic voice
I like how their friendship grew.
It was really interesting to see they change from rivals to friends
I like the supporting toys too.
For sure Woody and Buzz are amazing but also the other are perfect.
Isn't there a few Toy Story movies?
Yes for sure. On the begging the scene of Andy's party is really breathtaking don't you think?
Yeah, when he first got Buzz.
You still there?
For sure, and the other toys are very funny
Who is your favorite?
Ohh difficult  to say. But I suppose Mr Potato Head.
And what about your?
Bopeep I think 
And what about the scene on Pizza Planet. What a confusion, right?
Yeah!
but that's when the little aliens came in
For sure, and also all the run to be able to get there. Really nice.
And what about Andy's neighbor Sid. What a terrifying children for the toys, right?
Andy's RC car is really funny don't you think?
I don't remember either.
Woody flying back to Andy's car is really a nice one.
Have you enjoyed the end of the history?
What do you mean?
How the things come to the end, meaning a happy end right?
Oh definitely!
hello!
What is the name of the movie?
Despicable me is the name of the movie

I do like anmation movies

oh nice. Who is Gru voiced by?
Gru is voiced by Steve Carell
What rotton tomato score did it get>
It got a 81% on rotten tomatoes and an average of 6.8/10 
I think it was better than that for a comedy. Do you like movies that are good for all ages?
Wow thats pretty good
so both parents and adults would like it?
Yes! It is good for parents and kids. 
So what is the movie about? What happens in the movie?
The supervillain, Gru, has a rivalry with another villain named Vector after he steals the great pyramid.

this movie sounds really funny
What do the critics say about it?
critics said that is has "Despicable Me is a 3D cartoon comedy of whiplash-quick laughs, funny punch lines and a wickedly gimmicky appreciation for 3D."
I bet the 3d would be fun to see it it
in*
do you generally watch 3d movies?
not usually, but I would be interested
the ending is very cute too. I liked how there is a mid-air rescue
hi
Hey
so what movie r we chating bout
The notebook
It's a romantic drama
best and only romantiv film  i ever enjoyed
hello
The Inception was given a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 86%.
I see Leonardo DiCaprio starred in it as well as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page and Tom Hardy.
86% is a fair rating.  I felt that this movie was excellent but somewhat 'heady'.  I could see why it isn't everyone's cup of tea.  What rating would you give Inception?
I agree. 86% seems fair. 
There were some interesting characters in this movie. What character did you relate to most?
Leonardo DiCaprio was compelling in the role of Dom.  The Inception seems like a tailor fit role for DiCaprio.  I enjoyed his performance but found that the plot was so inventive that I had a hard time relating directly to any of the characters.  It seemed too divorced from reality.
Did this movie make you ponder the origins of your own thoughts?
Well, it was interesting, to say the least. The idea of planting something into another persons subconscious made me think for sure. 
It was pretty "out there".
Do you like scientific movies?
I adore them.  The more "out there" the better.  
Did you notice the complexity of the dreamscapes in the movie? I thought it was very inventive.
I'm having a hard time recalling some of the specifics.  It's hard to believe this film is almost 10 years old already!  I do recall them growing increasingly more complex and dream like the deeper they went though.
Did you notice in each dream there was a "kick"?
I did, I loved it!  It was like a dreamy Rube Goldberg contraption.  
Can you imagine yourself in a similar scenario?  They must have had a tremendous amount of trust for each other.  If anything went wrong they could have ended up in 'limbo'.  
I couldn't imagine it. Sounds very risky. Especially if the dreamer dies in the dream before the sedative wears off.
If the dreamer died and you end up in 'limbo', where do you think that is?  All of the extractors are living within that consciousness, what would become of them?  (since if he dies, that consciousness will cease to exist.)
Good question, and very thought provoking. In the movie they just went into limbo but I suppose the subconscious dreams would have to adjust to fit the new scenario. It would be scary to have the possibility of forgetting that you are in a dream at all. Do you think it would be worth  the potential setback?
I think that possibility is much greater than a setback.  I took it to mean that all the extractors as well as the subject would be trapped forever.  In that way it seems much too risky.  The aim is to plant an idea in someones mind without their realizing it, almost like mind control.  I think it would me much easier, and less risky, to sit and negotiate with someone.  Although, that's not at all subversive.  
Good point. What did you think about what happened to Mal?
Mal's conflict is pivotal to this film.  For all the layers of intrigue we have diving down into the dreams of the target, Mal's actions plant the idea in our minds that there could be many layers above as well.  Is the reality we began this film in reality at all?  What do you think?
Reality as we know it can be hard. If there was an alternate reality available that was more enjoyable I could see where Mal would want to believe it was the "real" reality. The dreams would have to be extremely detailed and believable to be that convinced. Since Mal committed suicide to attempt to "wake up" for real, I assume the beginning reality was the "real" one. Do you think Cobb should face murder charges for Mal's death?
Absolutely not, the audience knows the real truth.
I tend to agree. 
It's a good thing Ariadne had the kick setup for Fischer to wake up.
It is a good thing they didn't get trapped.  Memories of a dying parent would be very strong.  Would a new memory like this make you change your life?
I think it would. I would want to honor my dying parents requests. How about you?
I would too.  Would you stay in a dream forever if it were the reality you loved?  
It would certainly be tempting! How odd would it be to know you are in a dream yet you are getting older, living a whole life? Waking up, you'd be much younger then in the dream. Do you think that would make it more difficult to believe that it is the actual reality?
Well, it depends.  I'm growing older right now but I believe this is reality.  I'd certainly be happy to die, but then wake up a younger man!  But I have no difficulty believing this is reality because I don't know any better right now.  If I did know this was a dream I'd be happy to stay here because I'd get to live a whole extra life before my next.  What would you do?
Honestly, I'm not sure but I think it would make my mind play trick on me. "Wait, I just lived my life. How can I now be in a different one?" It would definitely hard to grasp.
What did you think of the spinning top totem?
I thought it was the perfect cinematic device.  The spinning creates so much anticipation for what comes next.  Will it fall over, won't it?  Puts you on the edge of your seat.
What kind of totem do you think you would have?
I think an eight ball would be exciting and create anticipation. 
hello
I know a movie you may like
What's the movie about?
It's actually sort of a musical
That's great! I love musicals. Are there any big name actors in the movie?
Ryan Gosling
Nice! It looks like the movie has pretty great ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and other review sites
It also has Emma Stone
Do you think you would like the movie?
I would love it.
I think I would love it as well
The critics love it.
do you like dancing in movies?
I do! 
What do you think of the two key scenes? Which one sounds more interesting to you?
I would like the first one just to see someone playing music soulfully
I agree. I think that scene sounds interesting
I just saw it has John Legend in it
Isn't he, like, a legend or something?
Haha I think so! 
I think the new scene, where Mia decides to write a one-woman play sounds cool
It's in LA.
I do like the setting
She does sound like a cool character
I'm more of a New York person myself
They both sound interesting. New York is a great place as well! 
LA is so flat isn't it?
And all that nasty stuff in the news about Hollywood
Yeah, it is. And expensive! 
The warm climate is appealing though
Do you like jazz?
I can appreciate jazz, but it's not one of my favorite genres. Do you?
not my favorite either
I prefer more forethought and craftsmanship in my music
improv doesn't suit me
I agree with that. I do appreciate that a contemporary movie is bringing jazz into it. Jazz isn't usually found in mainstream movies 
gotta go. peace.
Hi
what is the name of the movie?
Bruce Almighty 
what is the movie about
The movie is about a tv reporter who complains about Gods presence in his life guidance and so is offered the chance to do his job for one week
That sounds interesting.
It is a well written comedy, have you seen it?
 It features an all star cast of Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman, Lisa Ann Walker and Phillip Baker Hall. 
Not the whole thing just bits and pieces.
I like comedies with Jim Carrey in them
I have seen Even Almighty it similar to that one?
me too! 
I am not sure I at liberty to disclose that lol?
re: the rules
Ok
but  I will tell you a little more about the movie
ok that would be great
I keep meaning to watch it but seem to always forget
So Carreys character, Bruce Nolan, is a reporter. Hardworking, but not very successful. He has a lot of bad luck and reaches his limit when his co worker receives a promotion over him
He then starts his complaints to God who ends up responding with the proposition that gives him his powers
So its like walk in someone else's shoes to see what they have to deal with.
More as in "why God leaves some prayers unanswered"
oh ok
Bruce starts responding with yeses to all the prayers he receives, and as you can imagine that's were a lot of the conflict AND comedy come in to play
I enjoy comedy that is funny but has a good story line.
oh yea this one definetly has both and then the story to with Jennifer Annistons character as well
Would you recommend this movie?
oh yea 
From what you have said about Bruce Almighty it seems like a very good movie.
I actually forgot about it, and how well written it is now that I really think about it
its a bit of a tear jerker too lol
I am looking forward to adding it to my list of movies to watch.
I like feel good movies but do cry easy during movies that are tear jerkers.
I would add this one, its worth watching
I hope my movie store has it.
also seems to be a bit of a classic especially with it being Jim Carrey
or I will have to find someone that does.
I have netflix I will check there
Thank you for telling me about this movie I appreciate it.
you still have a movie store lol which one??
Family Video
Its the only one in town
I don't believe Netflix has it, but worth checking
also red box..
oh yes, we have one too I forgot about that
oh yeah i forgot about red box
they should have it, again it is a classic
either of them might and youre welcome!
I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
Great movie
HI.  97% on rotten tomatoes.  that's really good, must be pretty good
Have you seen it?
Steven Spielberg is an excellent director as well. 
Have not
Giant man eating shark attacking people makes for an entertaining watch
yeah
not much of a talker huh
Probably wouldn't be good for kids though
that depends
I love Richard Dreyfus, didn't realize he was in it
Of course the woman who is skinny dipping get's snagged first
closing the beaches, knee jerk reaction but probably a good idea
and of course they get greedy and want to pretend its a boating accident and not a shark attack
shark hunter over charging lol
bounty on the killer shark
do like this genre?4
hi
do you like frozen?
I love Frozen!
I love frozen yogurt! but also this movie :)
LOL!  I Cant wait for the second movie of Frozen to release
what is your favorite character?
Anna because shes independent!
yours?
I like Elsa
she reminds of my friend of the same name
also the character designs are cool
thats cool! Anna reminds me of my girls - they are red-heads too
do you like the songs?
Of course - who doesnt!  We still sing them around our house! 
that is awesome!
The first time we saw Frozen was on a Disney Cruise Ship 
what's your favorite?
I love Let it Go but also In Summer - especially now since its so cold!  Whats your favorite
i don't remember
do you have a favorite part of the movie
the snowman is a funny character
he is hilarious. 
olaf?
yes
do you have a favorite scene?
I really like the scene with the Trolls.  The ending also gets me every time when Elsa saves Anna. 
whats yours
the ending is great
the scene with the trolls too.
I hope the trolls are in the second movie more
haha maybe they will have their own spinoff movie
that would be cute too
nice chatting to you. Have a good day!
you too
Hello!
Hello! Today we're gonna talk about How to Train Your Dragon
Have you seen it before?
Awesome.  No, I have not had the chance, is it good?
Yes it has great ratings! It is rated 7.9/10 on Rotten Tomatoes
Who is in it?  Is it an animated movie?
The cast includes Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson, and America Ferrera
They all do an amazing job, and yes it is animated.
OMG Craig Ferguson is a riot!
What is it about, besides the obvious of dragon training, of course.
It is a coming to age story and has great friendship morals
Does the dragon talk?
one of the best scenes is when the dragon Hiccup is attacked by the bad guy Night Fury and rather than killing him, he sets him free
Yes, all of the dragons have some lines
So the dragon's name is Hiccup?
Yes the two main dragons are named Hiccup and Night Fury
Okay, Night Fury freed Hiccup then?
Yes, i guess it was the moral of the story.
Did the dragons breathe fire?
Another important scene is when Hiccup's owner sees that Night Fury is hurt and can not fly. He makes him a prostectic wing and thats how he teaches him how to fly
Im not too sure, but i bet they do. They probably only use it for good though since it is an animated movie aimed towards kids
Which part did Craig Ferguson give?
I would probably see this movie just because he is in it.  Do you think it's a good one to watch?
I meant to say, Which part did Craig Ferguson play?
He played Gobber the Belch, who was the training masters of the young warriors
Were the warriors humans or dragons?
well if you only like him then maybe no because his role is not a main role. If you like movies of the same genre then it may be a good fit.
It is a great movie to watch with children
The warriors were humans, and they were mostly kids. They owned and trained the dragons
Do you like movies like this?
I'm guessing that since the movie was aimed towards children that it had a happy ending?  Yes, I like some of them..  I don't go for a lot of singing in the animated movies though.  With the exception of the Wizard of Oz, that was a great movie, I could watch it over and over.
Yes, it has a happy ending. Thats great, theres no singing in this film. I think this is a feel good film 
It had great reception and even has 2 sequels
Sounds like it.  I would probably like it.
The fight scenes do tend to get kind of violent but they are very immerssoive
Hey, what's the movie name?
hello
I am reading the document, lets see, ok RE AL STEEL
HAve you seen it?
Oh I remember that, I haven't seen it but it's about fighting robots.
Did it get good reviews?
Interesting, in this write up, it does not mention robots until the last sentence
Do you remember who starred in the movie?
The wolverine actor. Can't remember his name.
Hugh Jackman
Yeah, that's it!
Also stars Dakota Goyo, but I do not know her at all (assuming iy is a woman)
You never know these days with names but I'd guess you are right!
That was probably Hugh's love interest in the movie.
Maybe not, the role is "Max'
I think that is Hugh's kid in the movie. 
so I guess we were wrong
Do you know how long it is? I'm not that interested in super long movies anymore.
also stars Evangeline Lilly (woman for sure"
Yeah, that must be the love interest.
Did you like the movie
The plot makes it seem like WWE
I haven't seen it. It looked ok in the previews though.
how so?
Fighting Robots
From what I remember, this is in the future so instead of humans fighting, robots fight.
and I guess Hugh used to be good at robot fighting but then they had some problems and they weren't good anymore.
But then they find a better robot and are good again.
seemed like a simplistic popcorn movie from the previews
I guess not WWE, but boxing, less humans, just robots
yeah
Honestly it seems dumb, orobably why I did not see it
probably made my disney too, so it could be a kiddy movie
does not sound kiddy
I don't think it was a mature movie though, it was marketed towards kids (teens)
not little kids
like the kind of movie you'd take a 14 year old to
In fact now that I read this, it sounds like one of the movies that is so stupid it might be "stupid enjoyable"
Yeah, it definitely sounds like that.
probably a feel good movie where they conquer all
Does it say what kind of problems they have in that document?
like what the main plot is about
This also sounds like that , I think, Brad pitt movie about underground fight venues
yeah except nobody is crazy like the brad pitt character
Illegal, mush be done out of the view of the law
I don't think it was illegal
maybe though
I remember there were crowds of people cheering them on
like it was an athletic specacle 
the write up says Now working as a small-time promoter, Charlie pieces together scrap metal into low-end fighters, barely earning enough to make it from one underground venue to the next. 
yup that's the struggle
then they find an amazing robot and get their revenge
so he starts out as illegal, then moves up in the world
makes sense
do you know if the robots have an intelligence?
Rotten Tomatos 59% rating
who cares about rotten tomatoes, their reviews are worthless
Says it was made by Dream Works, is that adisney company?
look up your fav movies on that site and I guarantee you'll be disappointed  by the low scores. 
no I think they compete with disney
they make similar animated movies
It seems Disney buys up everyone
yeah, they are a giant company. 
gives another rating of 56% (Metric score) ???
that is probably a rating at a different site
I've done this before and usually they provide 3 rating systems
rottoen tomatoes, something else then a cine something rating
Also stars Olga Fonda, is she related to Jane Fonda/Henry Fonda?
I have no idea
Yes a CinemaScore:A
they always have suspiciously high ratings
seems like Olga was born in Russia, so no, much better looking than Henry or Jane
lol
I think we're done now, thanks for the chat!
ok
bye
hi
what moviie did you see
hello how are you? Have you heard of Batman Begins? It is a great movie!
no tell me more
what is it about
It stars Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Liam Neeson. Great cast right? 
yes
it is

good
let's talk about Batman Begins. Are you familiar?
2005 SuperHero movie directed by Christopher  Nolan
Yes, I've heard of it. I just havent seen it yet
It's great
Rotten Tomatoes: 84% and average: 7.7/10
Metacritic Score: 70/100
CinemaScore: A
the most 'realistic' take on batman yet
I'm actually interested in seeing it. Doesn't it have Christain Bale as Batman?
yes
It stars Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, and Morgan Freeman.
great cast
Wow, even Morgan Freeman!? That is a good cast. Who does Freeman play?
He plays Lucious Fox. He's like Batman's Q (from 007)
the tech guy who helps him out. So it's less of a one-man operation
Yes, I remember the Character from the comics. That's awesome that they put him in the film. Does he play a big role? or is he just seen a little bit?
A fairly significant role. More-so in the sequels.
Also stars Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard, a devious villian and member of the League of Shadows
That is really cool, normally they give those kinds of characters small roles.
The league of shadows is in the film!? Wait so that means Neeson is Ras Algul?
Special guest appearance by Ken Watanabe as Ras Al Ghul
Do they mention his immortality in the film?
It's hinted at, but it's implied it's a mantle that's passed down for a more realistic take
As a child, Bruce Wayne falls down into a dry well and is attacked by a swarm of bats, subsequently developing a phobia of the creatures. While watching an opera with his parents, Thomas and Martha, Bruce becomes frightened by performers masquerading as bats and asks to leave. Outside, mugger Joe Chill murders Bruce's parents in front of him. Orphaned, Bruce is raised by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth.
Ah so they stick to the comic closely, thats a good thing.
Michael Caine must be Alfred. I can't see him playing anyone else.
Yes, origin-wise, it's pretty close. Bruce's traveling around the world and training is a part of it. Which has never been shown on screen before.
Yes he's an amazing Alfred
Fourteen years later, Chill is freed in exchange for testifying against Gotham City mafia boss Carmine Falcone. Bruce intends to murder Chill, but one of Falcone's assassins does so first. Bruce's childhood friend, assistant district attorney Rachel Dawes, berates him for attempting to undermine the justice system, saying that his father would be ashamed. Bruce confronts Falcone, who tells him that real power comes from being feared. Bruce decides to travel the world and learn how to confront injustice. While serving a prison sentence for theft in Bhutan, he meets Henri Ducard, who trains him as a member of the League of Shadows, led by Ra's al Ghul. After completing his training and purging his fears, Bruce learns that the League intends to destroy Gotham, believing it to be corrupt, decadent, hypocritical and beyond saving. Bruce rejects the League's cause and burns down their temple during his escape. Ra's is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves the unconscious
I can only imagine the sarcastic jokes he makes in the film. Caine is perfect for that character.
He has some gread monolouges
Batman intercepts a drug shipment, provides Rachel with evidence against Falcone, and enlists Sergeant James Gordon, one of the few honest cops left in Gotham, to arrest him. In prison, Falcone meets with Dr. Jonathan Crane, a corrupt psychiatrist whom he has helped smuggle drugs into Gotham, and threatens to reveal his complicity if he does not declare  him mentally unfit for trial. Crane puts on a scarecrow mask and sprays Falcone with a fear- inducing hallucinogen that drives him insane (which causes Falcone to constantly mouth the  word "Scarecrow"), and has him transferred to Arkham Asylum. While investigating "the Scarecrow", Batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated. He is saved by Alfred and given an antidote developed by Fox. When Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, Crane reveals that he has been pouring his fear-inducing drug into Gotham's water supply. He drugs Rachel with it, but Batman saves her and subdues Crane, who claims to work for Ra's al Ghul. Batman evades the police to get Rachel to safety, administers the antidote, and gives her a vial of it for Gordon and another for mass production. Ducard reappears at Bruce's birthday party and reveals himself to be the true Ra's al Ghul. Having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from Wayne Enterprises, he plans to vaporize Gotham's water supply, rendering Crane's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city. He sets Wayne Manor aflame and leaves Bruce to die, but Alfred rescues him.
Interesting Scarecrow is even in the film. That seems like a lot of plot if they have multiple villans in the film.
How was the story in your opinion?
It does not crowd the film in my opinion. Unlike how it turned out with Batman and Robin.
You can have multiple villians as long as you use them correctly
I thought it was a great story. OVerall very solid
I agree,  does the League ever bump heads with Crane in the film?
Or do they work together?
Yes, and it fits naturally.
Hi  What's up?
I only see that you have entered the room.  Are we chatting?
Are you there?
Yes, sorry
Have you seen Monsters University?
Was almost ready to give up.
I was reading the directions
No is that a Pixar movie?
Yes it's a Pixar movie from 2013
okay and was it fun?
Yes, it is a prequel for the Monsters Inc movie from 2001. It stars John Goodman and Billy Crystal as the main characters.
All I can see is what you write
oh two good actors   what happens in it?
It's about the main characters, Mike and Silley. They are going on a school field trip.
I take it that it's their voices
Yes, they play the main characters. It's a computer animated movbie.
And in a bus?
what kind of antics do they do?
Mike goes on a field trip to Monsters Inc on a school trip and decides he wants to be a scarer when he grows up. He goes to Monsters University when he grows up and meets Sulley.
I think my screen has a delay and doesn't move very quickly
I have to read the info they are providing and then tell you information about it, so it takes a few seconds for me to write
a scarey?
Okay so it's not me then?
a scarer. Basically they harvest energy from scaring children at night.
No it's not you
oic  monsters under th bed kind of?
So they join a fraternity on campus and try to enter the Scare Games, kind of like Hunger Games I guess.
Yes, like that, or in a closet.
okay I get the idea
They have a hard time during the Scare Games and get disqualified.
I'm sorry if this is not making sense. The plot seems a little ridiculous, lol
what?  they don't know how to scare?
I haven't seen it so lllll
So, when they enter the Scare Games, one of them cheated, so they get disqualified. Sulley was the one who cheated. 
I never go see this type of movie now that I don't have kids to go with me.
They go to "college" to learn the best strategies to scare.
now that is funny!
I saw the first one and it was really good, but my kids were young then. Now I have no reason to see it.
Well, I guess I have to go see for myself.  It's probably on TV somewhere.
So, after they get disqulified from the Scare Games, they both take jobs at Monsters, Inc, in the mail room and they work their way up until they are able to join the "scarer team"
It got 79% on Rotten Tomatoes.
okay  bye now
Bye
Hello! Isn't Monsters University a great movie? It was true to the spirit of Monsters, Inc. and matched its tone. 
I agree.  It was a good movie
What was your favorite part?
I liked when Mike and Sully didn't finish the program and worked their way up the ranks anyways.
Me too! It was very inspiring and showed that you can accomplish your dreams many ways. I liked how the movie expanded on the monster world. 
Yes.  The first movie only gave one facet of the world, while the second developed the setting to a much larger degree.
When I heard they were making another Monsters Inc movie I expected a sequel, not a prequel. But I ended up loving it! Did you see it in theatres?
I don't think we saw it in the theatre.  I think we rented it.  It's been a while though.  I should show it to my kids.  They would probably like it.
I bet they would! I don't have kids but my coworkers do. I love Disney/Pixar movies so I recommend them to my coworkers a lot. 
I really enjoy Randy Newman's music on this, the Toy Story movies, and Finding Nemo/Dory.
Me too! I think the Toy Story movies might be my favorite Pixar movies. Did you hear that they're building a Toy Story Land in Walt Disney World this summer? 
I did hear that.  It sounds pretty interesting.  
I'm going to WDW in the fall so I'm excited to see how the park is. Have you ever been? Or to Disneyland?
I've been to WDW a few times.  Never to Disneyland though.  California is pretty far away from me.  We went camping at WDW last year though.  It was great.
That's what I'm doing in the fall! I'm really looking forward to camping there!
It was really great.  We camped for four nights I think.  It rained like crazy the first day, but it was still fun.
Do you like Mike or Sulley better?
Oh good question! I think I like Mike more. He's weirdly optimistic. 
How about you?
I like Mike because he's funnier.  He had some of the best lines in the first movie.
He is SO funny!! 
I always liked John Goodman's voice acting for Sully, though. It's perfect for a big, fluffy monster
The part at the end of the first movie when he burps out the microphone makes my kids laugh so hard.
I agree. John Goodman was a great choice for Sulley.
Hahah I bet!!! 
I love the scare machine they had in the prequel that the students had to frighten for the contest. That was pretty neat
Yeah, though I was really disappointed with Sulley for cheating.
I was too, that broke my heart. I cried when that happened!
It was really a cruel thing for him to do to MIke
It seemed a little out of character for Sulley, but I guess they had to have some final source of conflict between the two to keep the plot moving.
I agree, it was probably my least favorite part of the movie. I feel like they could have taken the story in a different direction.
For Sully to trick Mike into thinking he was scary was just so hurtful! 
I do like that they ended up working so hard to achieve their dreams though.  That's a good message that Disney started doing with the Princess and the Frog.
Me too! I like that common thread between the two movies. I think it was executed better in this though, because they really did start from the very bottom of Monsters, Inch
And it explains why they're always nice to the other nerdy janitors in the original movie.  They were once in that same position.
Oh my gosh!!! I didn't even realize that! I have to rewatch the movie. You're totally right!
It does show a really good message for kids, to be respectful of everybody
It's a valuable message.  Be kind and respectful to everyone.  Don't expect to lean on your credentials or family reputation to get you somewhere in life.  Just be prepared to work your hardest.
Yes! I liked that they showed Sully as this spoiled brat at first who eventually learned that you can't always lean on your family's reputation. It can only get you so far
Maybe his spoiled background is why he cheated in the competition, because he didn't really realize the consequences of his actions, just did what he thought was right
I feel like a lot of kids need that message these days.
You've got a good point there about the cheating.
And you have a good point there about kids needing that message!
I like that they had to work hard together too, so it didn't feel like so much of a struggle. Because Mike and Sully had each other to share in that struggle of working their way up the corporate ladder
Hello!
What do you think of John Lee Hancock?
Hello.  
Hi
You seen this movie before?
Once a long time ago!
Who is in it?
Same. Leonardo dicaprio pulls off jay really well
but i think its kind of a bland film tbh
what do you think?
I love him!
It's bland?
I remember it being pretty good!
He's such a great actor too
what's the movie about?
he really is a great actor
its about a rich guy with rich guy problems
i cant relate haha
hahahah oh when did it come out?
2013. how was it rated?
I think it received a 48% on rotton tomatoes and average 5.8/10
that's not very good!
ouch for the director
The director was Baz Luhrmann
DOn't know him
nearly 200 million dollar budget for 5.8/10
smh
think you'd watch it again?
damn, they probably didn't make much money in the theatre
maybe... I don't remember it much
only for leonardo decaprio
have you seen the book?
it's about Jay Gatsby
no. we did it a school years ago but i pretended i read it
no kid wants to read a romantic drama book
have you read the book?
i'd love to go to a big gatsby party
it'd be so fun
still there?
hi
here
im sorry
I like romantic drama
however, this movie seemed more drama
It was also very fantasized
Who was Daisy again?
Was that the girl he was in love with?
very true
daisy was his friend gf i think
im not so sure
seems more like wanting what he cant have than love
Yeah, i agree
it's from scott fitzgerland's novel
didn't know he was the author
1925 novel
do you remember who pamela is?
Dunkirk seems interesting
It is, it's about a historical event that happened during WWII
It got excellent reviews from Rotten Tomatoes 
Yeah those are some very high ratings
Do you like war movies?
I love war movies, especially ones based on historical events
are you familiar with the premise of Dunkirk?
I am not
It was about a failed attack where British and Candian soldiers were trapped 
they had to pull all available boats including civilian vessels to help all the troops escape
Yeah seems pretty intense
it was, with no help, lots of soldiers attempted to flee as fast as they could
Crazy stuff
Moonstone seems like an interesting name for a boat
it is, but everyone has their own preference 
Huh why is Gibson pretending to be a British Army private
with all that's going on, i think you will do whatever you need to try and escape the madness
I see. So he wants to escape too
absolutely 
you can see just about everyone does anything, hiding, figuring ways to get out
That's pretty sad huh
fight or flight sometimes, young kids fighting a war they know not much about
Everyone just wants to live
agreed, the terrors are war are long forgotten as heros are always celebrated for victories
True true
just like the solider being pulled out of the water
It seems the evacuation was a success here
it was, they were able to save enough lives to fight another war
or should i say battle
Hmm. it's sad lives become trivialized. they become another resource to exploit for the country
Anyways thank you for discussing the movie with me
yes but a good watch to really understand, thank you
Hello
Hello. How are you?
I'm good. Did you enjoy the movie?
Yes, I love musicals, and you? 
I think they are tolerable, but this one was pretty good.
I like that it was located in LA and made it pretty relatable.
Do you live in L.A.?
Vegas
Oh very cool. I'm in the South
Are you a Gosling's fan?
Emma Stone fan?
I really like them both. Which is your favorite?
Both are good actors, Goslings more attractive. HA!
What did you think of the filmâs perspective on success and satisfaction? 
I think I lost you somewhere in the conversation. Since it has been 5 minutes without a response from you, I am going to abandon the discussion. 
Have a great day
Thanks for the conversation
?
?
?
?

Hello
The movie is John Wick. Have you seen it before?
I just watched it yesterday 
Did you enjoy it?
yeah I thought it was awesome
I thought the same thing when I watched it. Keanu was amazing in it.
I feel like they dont make movies like that anymore, like action movies
They really don't and they should start making this style.
Yeah exactly 
It was nice to see John Leguizamo make a little bit of a comeback.
I dont remember seeing him in the first one
I would have had the same reaction as Wick  to anyone who killed the puppy my dead wife gave to me.
yeah your right I would have gone insane.
It was interesting to see a part of the assassin world. John Wick's car was pretty beautiful until it got stolen.
I was thinking the same thing yesterday his car is cool.
Hey
Hi
Howâs it going?
Pretty good. Are you a Marvel fan?
Good to hear. Sure, what about you?
Yes, I am a huge Marvel fan. One of my favorites is the Avengers. Mark Ruffalo is great as The Hulk. 
Sure, I liked the Avengers a lot.
I also think Ruffalo is a great Hulk.
Is Avengers the movie weâre supposed to talk about?
Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 92% rating and average of 8/10. Yes, I believe so. 
Okay then. Right, Iâve always experiened that IMDB gives movies a lower average rating than rotten tomatoes.
Tha
That's true
But I guess 92 and 80 are a fair assesment.
Yeah, I think Joss Whedon was a good choice for director also. His vision was really inline with the comics. 
Well, I canât speak for the comics (havenât read them), but this movie is a great mashup of all the heroes and their stories.
I guess itâs just a very good movie with an amazing plot.
I agree. 
Loki using Clint Barton to help him with the Tesseract was awesome too. I like him even though he's a bad guy
Right, that was a great scene.
Lokiâs a likable villain Iâd say.
It was interesting how it caused such a riff within The Avengers. Thor still felt like he had loyalty to him for a long time during the movie. 
You think?
I thought he was pretty ruthless with him.
Thatâs just my opinion obviously.
I can see that somewhat but he could have done a lot more damage if he wanted to. 
Do you have a specific example on mind?
The end fight scene definitely was. He could have killed him. 
Oh, the one where Hulk ends up hitting him?
Yeah, that was classic. One of the funniest moments of the movie. I also liked when Iron Man fell back through the wormhole. It had everyone on edge I think. 
Absolutely. Epic scenes.
Can we talk about other movies or just this one?
You know, MCU
I also like the way Nick Fury stood his ground with the Council. Just this one. 
Understood.
Yeah, Furyâs great too.
So, any final thoughts?
It's crazy that the Council wanted him to drop a nuclear missile into New York. 
Great examples, man.
It was great talking to another MCU fan.
Take care now!
Definitely! You too!
I wonder why there is a gap in the Rotton Tomatoes score and the Metacritic score for Wonder Woman
hello! that is very strange, maybe they have different audiences, did you originally see this as a war movie? I guess i personally separate war movies from super hero movies
I do that too, I think of them both as different genres, even though Wonder Woman was set during World War 1.
Yeah I could see them grouping it together, I just usually separate them, I enjoy the actors though, Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are great, how did you feel about their choices?
I thought the casting was great, even though this was the first time I ever heard of Gal Gadot.
I was shocked though it was so well received with cirtics considering its a DC film haha, usually Marvel runs the place
I agree. I think one of the reasons it was well received was because Wonder Woman was trying to end the war, instead of contributing to a growing conflict.
yeah, a lot of the marvel movies tend to just make up a conflict and then go with it instead of going off an existing one. I enjoyed it though, It is interesting the difference in opinions though, I don't know if I would see a second one 
I think if Patty Jenkins directs a sequel, it would be as good as the first one. She did a great job with this movie.
thats true, if they can keep the cast and crew together I think the chances of it being a hit increase. I believe thats more then 3 exchanges we've had about the movie now
The document just updated for me. One of the things that caught my eye of the movie is how the time period was depicted, especially with how Princess Diana received a photographic plate whereas now we can take selfies. It is an interesting disconnect.
Oh mine just updated too, sorry about that. I think thats interesting and a good period for the film, I think the mythology involved behind it was very intriguing 
I agree. Usually whenever Greek or Roman mythology is presented in a movie it is dense and opaque, but it was easily understood in Wonder Woman.
Yeah introducing concepts like that can definitely be hard to follow sometimes depending on how they're presented. It's interesting that zues chose amazonian warriors to protect mankind
The way Ares was punished was also interesting, with only Zeus able to wound him in the battle.
I liked that it was only them left, zues and ares had to fight to save mankind, it made it interesting with it being in a time period where the first time in history we had a world war
I thought it was interesting that the American pilot crashed near south America, connecting World War 1 to the Amazonian setting was done very well in the film in my opinion.
yeah it seems they did a very good job of having the plot points connect with real world situations, the island then being invaded by the germans looking to advance their warfare technology really gives you a sense of good side/bad side
Especially with the Germans trying to engineer an even deadlier version of the chemical weapons they had, I think that ties very well into everyone's ingrained mortality. 
I also like that Hippolyta allowed her sister to train Diana, giving her the extra she needed to really stand out from the amazonian warriors 
I felt that was a very feminist-inspired scene, which I really enjoyed seeing in the film. That was a big dynamic in how the World War was almost exclusively fought by men, with the sole woman wanting to end it.
that is a really interesting point that I haven't considered, I know that the film was widely proclaimed to give a voice to feminism but that point really solidifys that
I really didnt except Sir Patrick to Ares, its an interesting dynamic that really came out. 
I thought the scene when Sir Patrick revealed himself as Ares also influenced that, where he wanted to use the Godkiller sword to destroy humanity, but Wonder Woman said no.
yeah I really didn't except wonder women to be the godkiller although it does make sense
I think that was another big feminist point in the movie, in my opinion. The ending of the movie was very heartfelt and connected how wars of the past influence our present when Princess Diana emailed Bruce Wayne
yeah, I think the dynamic between the all the characters fits really well, linking it all togheter, from diana and bruce, to diana and ares, and ares and zues
The casting helped make the movie incredible, the charisma and chemistry between every character showed. The scene where Steve hijacked the bomber showed that very well I think.
Steve has a really inteseting role in the movie too, providing a lot of support but still not taking over the main role 
His character was an excellent supporting character in my opinion.
Hello there!
hey
So tell me a little bit about this movie :)
have you seen the movie frozen?
I actually have not...but I've heard let it go too many times for comfort.
How do you feel about the movie? Care to share a little bit?
They say its the best animated movie Disney has put out since Beauty and the beast
I think it was a great movie. The songs are adorable. good for kids. even the critics liked it
Hmm I think I'll have to check it out. So I can at least say that I've seen it then ! :)
yes. its a story of two princesses. Elsa and Anna
Who doesn't like princesses? Whats the story line like?
Princess Elsa has magic powers but is insecure about since she injured her sister when they wonder. It became to much and she ran away
Well that's depressing
Their parent died and Ana has to find her sister so they can run the country together. 
So what's the storyline?
Well Elsa runs away after their parents died. Ana goes on this journey to find her sister and help her sister control her magic so they can return home. Its a cute movie for the kids
Sounds interesting. Maybe I'll kidnap one of my nieces or nephews and.watch it with them. Thanks! 
They will love it. Theres even a love story within the plot as well. Everyone loves a prince and princess love story
Haha I guess that's true. I do prefer realism but I do appreciate that Disney throws in adult concepts in children's stories that go right over children's heads
haha yeah they always do that dont they
Rented it online. It's a party!
lol almost makes me want to watch it again
So, now I guess we just hang out until they let us proceed! Let it good!
Let it go* ... Lame.
haha. As much as ive heard the movie songs I still enjoy it from time to time
I just remember my niece's birthday. Must've heard that song 200 times...in a row
Me too. I like the charatcter Olaf. I see him everywhere. Hes a talking snowman. he becomes one of their friends. very cute
There can only be one neighborhood snowman, and that's Frosty! :O
lol Frosty is a classic. But olaf  is really small so Frosty stil has that title
Hi have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
I have and I loved it! How did you like it?
It was better than I was expecting. Looks like alot of people liked it. Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 92% score
Yes, 92% is a great score for the movie, especially with a CinemaScore of an A also. Everyone I know who watched it thought it was great.
I think because it had something for everyone. Action and a beautiful woman for the guys and a strong female character for the gals.
Indeed, plus it was the first time ever that a female director directed a comic book superhero movie.
Ah I didn't catch that. That's right. It makes me want to see the rest of the upcoming  DECU movies more
The plot was great, it was about a Amazonian princess who leaves her home behind to try to solve the conflict in the "outside" world. Very action-packed.
Yeah the scenery was great. And Chris Pine too.3 .
Of course, who wouldn't want Chris Pine as a love interest!
The Greek mythology was a nice touch to the standard superhero formula
The Greek mythology was great, but I thought it was a bit confusing.
Yeah I'm sure that wasn't explained as well as it should have, but they probably needed to get to the bang bang scenes faster
True, people went for the action for sure. I personally like movies with a bit more of a back story.
Right, I wouldn't mind an extra 5-10 minutes with more detailed story about Ares and Zeus
Yes, t hat and also about how Zeus met an Amazonian. 
The training scenes were great with her mom the Queen though
I mean her mom's sister, her auntie
Oh for sure! I loved seeing the evolution of how she trained and how strong she got.
I'm glad they made the lasso a strong weapon.
Yes. I also liked the scene when Diana saves Steve when he crashes into the ocean. A woman saving a man in a movie for once.
Yeah there was alot of feminine cheering  in the theater for that scene
I hated that her aunt died when the Germans invaded though.
yeah that was sad, pretty unavoidable though to advance the story and give gravitas to WW's journey
How did you like Sir Patrick?
I was a little surprised by his reveal, but I wasn't paying much attention to everyone else outside of WW, CP and the scenery tbh
I saw that coming. Too predictable that he was Ares I thought.
right, but there's only so much they can do it's a huge movie designed for the masses, not for those with discriminating tastes ;)
Haha, very true! I thought it was neat that they started the story by Diana reminiscing while looking at an old picture though!
yeah the ending reminded me of Captn America with his story in the past and waking up to the modern day world
Yes, but from different universes ;)
Heh at this point it doesn't really matter unless you're really invested in either universe
True. Can't wait till the next installment! 
But with CP taking the bomber away to detonate is just like Captn America going to the Arctic to destroy HIS bom b
yeah, im sure it'll be a great one
For sure, many similarities. I have to say I liked Wonder Woman more so than Batman VS Superman.
Hmmm wonder why this doc hasn't moved on. it's been awhile
hey
I have seen this Dunkirk
Christopher Nolan is a good director for these types of movies.
It was awesome and yes Nolan is best
2017 film based on war
I haven't seen the movie yet, but hear the action scenes are quite realistic.
must see, I suggest
why there are critics always criticizing  
I think it will win some awards.
It might have, have to check google
its rating is 8.6 which is awesome
A 94 is a really good score considering metacritic is really hard on movies.
yup
I didn't know that it was shot on IMAX film.
what's that
IMAX screens are large screens in specialty theaters. They're like 3 stories tall.
IMAX 65 mm
oh...
will look after while, will read about it
How was Harry Styles? Did you recognize him when you saw it?
no, I don't remember much
I like that they're making war pictures like this again.
yes, I too
Did you think the movie was accurate to the history?
May be, but can't say with full confidence as have to look for history first
or have to read what Nolan thought making this movie
The way I learned it in school, the British could have lost the war right there if they had been wiped out at Dunkirk.
oh, 
lucky one
Who was your favorite actor from the cast?
The one who was shown in the train in the last scene.
they were fearing they might not be appreciated but opposite was peoples reaction
Is it worth watching on streaming?
You should must watch in some good print.
U will love it 
since you are more familiar with UK history, you will like it the most
but depends on your taste of genre
Was there German submarines in it too? I love some U-Boat action as well.
No, but air combat is shown from start to end
better watch than get the clue. lol
filming began in May 2016 and ended in sept. WOW!!!
There's probably a lot of green screen and special effects that goes into a movie like this.
yes
lets finish conversation
I can see this option now
happy chatting
OK, nice talking to you.
Hello. Do you like movies?
Yes, but ones based on old toys are werid
This one is called Real Steel and I trying to remember if I've watched it.
I haven't, no interest in it
I agree with the reviewer stating it's Rocky with robots
I also think it's a little bit inspired by rock em sock em robots, an old toy
Okay. I do remember watching it, because I saw that Hugh Jackman was in it. 
Sometimes I'll watch these if they keep my interest. I think I only watched it because of him.
He is a good actor Nice to see him as someone other than Logan once in a while, lol
Yea, I like thrillers or drama, who-dun-it kind of movies.
This is more of an action film with robots
Rotten tomatoes gives it 59 percent. I guess that means they say it's an ok kind of move. I remember the boxing robots though.
The deal where the winner gets the loser's robot seems a bit extreme
Lol. I see the movie was filmed totally in Michigan. Good for them. Tax credits. 
Yeah, that was nice while it lasted. Seems to have dried up though
I live in Ohio and I hear about those "credits" for movies being made here. Normally I'd watch Hugh Jackman in other movies.
He's a decent actor. 
Didn't realize this movie was that old - 2011, time goes quick. I don't recognize the other actors.
Neither do i
This reads like a standard boxing movie... but with robots
Do you like boxing as a sport?
Nah
I don't like most sports though
I'm reading through here looking for interesting facts about the movie. It says the film's based on a short story called "Steel" which was orginally published in 1956, later adapted into a Twilight Zone episode in 1963. Now that's interesting. The old Twilight Zone shows frightened me. lol
I love old Twilight Zone but don't recall the one this is based on
True. Weird, but even today some of the episodes spooked me.  It says the Metacritic Score 56/100. Who's Metacritic? 
I think they're another review aggregate site?
I watch the Twilight Zone mrathons on Syfy all the time
If I watch them, it's only in daytime. I'm such a wimp. lol. I'm not familiar with director either - Shawn Levy
Doesn't ring any bells for me either
Genre is Science, Sports, yep that's true.
what was your opinion on the movie?
It does sound pretty interesting and I can see the reviews are pretty high
I personally have watched this movie. I thought it was super cute and it can be related to general life.
are you familiar with any of the actors?
Yes the short reviews at the bottom suggest it is thought provoking. 
I can't say for sure but gennifer Goodwin sounds familiar
Have you seen any other movies from the director? 
Honestly, when I watch movies, I hardly ever pay attention to who made it. 
have you?
Nope. I am a sucker for movies with animated animals though so I will definitely have to check this out. 
Yea, Judy Hopps is the main character and is considered the first ever bunny cop. Sounds funny. 
Agreed. There's a comment at the bottom about species stereotypes which sounds interesting too
But they thought she would be able to handle being a cop  because shes a bunny.
Most of the cop or police are normally these big animals.
Yep. Which to me is a bit counterintuitive because you think of rabbits being a prey species so more likely to run away from trouble. 
Exactly.
Of course the fox has to be the bad guy
Actually, he is displayed as the slick fox. Always trying to con his way in to something.
But he turns out to be a good guy. 
I'm trying to figure out who otterton and Manchas are from the new paragraph that flashed up
Oh so like another goes away from the norm type of character in the fox
Key scene two shows rabbit and fox working together! 
Otterton is a missing person that judy is trying to find
Judy kind of blackmailed Nick(fox) in working with her.
I see. It sounds like a movie that has a well developed story line
It was a very good kids movie.
I'm just shocked that it wasn't as big as the Disney movies
Oh ok. I'm a little bit wary of rotten tomato ratings also
They can sometimes stray quite far from the other review sites of a bunch of very keen reviewers want to bump the score
Ok scene three has some drug manufacturing going on! 
Yes, the drugs make the animals revert to their natural state.
Oh so there must be some other force making them break moulds
They become crazy animals again
But this is all while they still think Judy is a small cop
so they still dont consider her a strong animal
I see. Interesting. Hope she gets more respect later with all the arrests
yea she does
would you see this movie?
Hello.
Hi, I think you should watch LaLa Land. It sounds like it is an amazing movie
Who stars in the movie?
Ryan Gosling, Emma stone, and John Legend
I like Ryan Gosling. He is a good actor, but I heard that it was a musical. Is that correct?
Yes, it is a musical romatic comedy! It has the best off all the things that make you feel good! Romance,and comedy.
I cannot imagine Ryan Gosling in a musical, but I guess it could work.
Where does the movie take place?
He plays as the Jazz pianist, and he falls in love with Emma Stone. It takes place in Los Angeles. 
Is Emma Stone playing an artist also?
She is a aspiting actress in this film. They are both pursuing their dreams. 
What part does John Legend play?
I am not sure what part he pays. In the first part Ryan Gosling is at a party and he plays a cover of I Ran (So far Away), he feels like the song is an isult for a serious musician
What is the time period of the movie? Is it a modern story?
Yes I think it is modern time period
Have you seen the movie?
No I have not seen it yet, I want to though. I want to know if they stay together or they have a struggle with their relationship
Relationships are tough. I wonder how the two characters handle theirs.
Emma who plays Mia, writes her own one women play. That sound interesting! Ryan who is playing Sebastian is performing regualry at a club and they move in together. I am thinking they sound like a fun couple.
Do you know what the play is about?
No, sadly I do not know what it is about. I do know that Sebastian does not enjoy the music his band plays in 
Is there alot of dancing also?
I am not sure on that, but I would think there is. Sounds like it is filled with music! I love a good musical
I do too, if it is done well.
Does Emma Stone sing as well?
When their band has the first tour Mis and Sebastian get into an argument! He thinks she wants him to be unsuccessful
That doesn't bode well for the relationship.
I think she is just an aspiring actress, not a singer. He misses her first play where noone shows up, and she owes the theater money and moves to Nevada since she can not pay. Getting very interesting!
Does he go with her to Nevada?
No, she is mad and not forgiving him for missing her play. Her first play sounds like it was a bust
It sounds like it. Writing plays must be difficult. Sounds like she took it hard.
John Legend plays Keith, he is a band member. I bet hes a great bank member!
I bet you are right.
I am sure she just did not have enough experience for the play writing and how to execute the play and promote it. 
Well, this sounds like an interesting movie. Thanks for all the information.
I do hope you will see it. I want to see how the realtionship plays out during the film. 
Sounds great.
Hello
Hello
I just watched Batman vs. Superman, have you seen it yet?
No I haven't
It's the first movie like this with Batman and Superman together.
That sounds good
Batman is played by Ben Affleck.  He gets tricked into fighting Superman.
Who plays Superman?
Henry Cavill.  Wonder Wo man is in it too.
I like him, he's a good actor.
I love Wonder Woman. Who plays Wonder Woman?
I'm not sure of her name, b ut Laurence Fishburne and Holly Hunter are in it too.
I like both of them. The movie sounds good. How long is it?
It's 153 minutes so it's fairly long.  There's a part where Bruce Wayne/Batman seeks out kryptonite in the Indian Ocean as a deterrent.
It didn't get very good critics scores.
That is a long movie. I enjoy long movies, especially in the theaters. It sounds interesting. What did the critics have to say about it?
CinemaScore graded it as a B, Rotten Tomatoes 4.9/10 and Metacritic Score was 44/100. One of the critics said it wasn't as good as Dark Knight but it was better than Man of Stee.
Steel.
Wow. Those are really low scores! I am surprised at that. Usually these types of movies are popular and do well.
Yeah, agreed.  In one part of the movie, Superman's mom gets kidnapped and the kidnapper demands he kill Batman for his Mom's release.
And what happens once his mom is released?
She isn't released that way, because Batman realizes right before he kills Superman that they are both being tricked.  Batman ends up rescuing Superman's Mom, and Superman goes after the kidnapper.
Does Superman have a fight with kidnapper?
And who wins
Yes, Superman confronts the kidnapper, whose name is Luthor, played by Jesse Eisenberg, on the Kryptonian scout ship.
That sounds exciting. Is Wonder Woman in the movie a lot?
Luthor gets arrested and then Batman goes to visit him in prison.  I don't want to tell you the outcome of the fight because I don't want to ruin the ending.  No, Wonder Woman doesn't have a very big part.
I love Wonder Woman! Yes, don't give away the outcome because I want to see it! 
I think you'll really like it.  I don't always believe the critics, you never know what else is going on with them.
I think I would too. I try not to listen too much to them either. I have seen some really good movies that the critics just rip to shreds. 
There may have been a movie coming out the same weekend they were friends with the director or something loke that.
like
Well I hope you enjoy it.  If nothing else, it is a must-see just to have Batman and Superman fighting.
I think I will enjoy it! 
Okay it's been good chatting with you.  Have a great day!
You too!! Thank you 
okay bye
Bye
It sounds like a good movie. It sounds like it is a good monsters inc successor.
I agree. I'm slightly disappointed by the Rotten Tomatoes score. Then again, it is the first time that Pixar has made a prequel film. 
Do you typically watch movies like Monster's University?
Typically no since i generally like to watch anime. But if the franchise is one i watched when i was a kid. Then I usually will make a effort to see it.
And i agree those scores kinda seem rather low.
I understand. Just by glancing at the ratings, do you think you'd make an effort to go see the prequel? Or would the score discourage you from seeing the film?
Id still see it despite bad reviews. I generally like to decide things by myself to see if i like it or not. Like if 99% of people say its bad or good. I usually won't follow what i hear. I just go and experience it for myself. And then from there I usually say its cool or  say its bad.
Makes sense. I typically only pay attention to the ratings when it's a director who I am familiar with. If I know that their work is usually phenomenal and a particular movie has awful ratings, I usually will wait to hear from friends/family before paying to see it. 
Also im a fan of comedy movies. So I'll probably enjoy for the memes and jokes.
Ya same.
Comedy movies are always a must see in my book. 
And if im being honest, pixar usually makes good movies so I have good expectations. Illumination movies is what im " iffy" about.
I love that Monster's University has a fraternity involved. Even more so love it because they call it Roar Omega Roar.
Mike is 7???? What in the...I never knew that.
ya that name is great.
He's only seven when he goes on the field trip. He goes to college eleven years later. So he'd be eighteen.
I misread that at first too. 
ahhh I see well that clears that up.
Looks like this movie is pretty heavily based on cartoon fraternities. 
yep
I find it odd that Pixar has a scene in this movie where Sulley tampers with the machine to get better scores. Doesn't really promote the whole 'fair play' imagine to their age demographic. 
Oozma Kappa. I can't believe they threw a kappa meme in there.
Every movie with a fraternity/sorority always contains 'Kappa.' Ever notice that?
ya. Its pretty much a dead meme.
Am i slow for thinking hardscrabble was male until this passage? lol
Wonder what CDA stands for in this movie. Clearly, it's some form of an enforcer but what type of enforcer does a monster have? 
idk maybe to make sure they are scary enough.
Nope! I thought the same. I think it was because there was no gender context to go off of in the last paragraph. 
yeah probably.
Well it sounds like a safe movie for the kids.
No, I don't think it's to make sure they're scary enough... the CDA has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their expulsion from the university. 
Although i  expect a few hidden adult jokes cause college and fraternity makes me think they slip one or two in there.
Ah i see that would make sense.
I agree. I was skeptical about the cheating portion of the movie as that doesn't coincide  with a kids film and what you'd want to teach the kids at this age level but they do bring in negative reinforcers for the monster's actions,. 
True. Movies these days are getting so caught up in formulaic tropes that kids pick up on them.
I hope the movie stays fresh and a bit unpredictable.
Keep the kids on their toes.
One can only hope. 
And still be smart enough to let the parents enjoy it.
A 79% on a kids movie doesn't seem too bad in my opinion after reading the key scenes.
Thats why past pixar films in my opinion were so good. And still seem better than movies today.
Thats true. I think overall it sounds like a good movie.
Let's get started.
Have you ever seen the movie John Wick?
Yes, with that actor who was in the Matrix flicks.
Yes, that's the one.
What did you think?
I thought it was his best film.
Hi
hello. have you seen this movie?
Yes, I've watched The Wolf of Wall Street.
How about you?
I have not. do you agree with the rating of the move listed?
Yes.
I agree with the rating of this movie.
For me the movie is average. Nothing special.
78% is still a good rating.
do you think that Leo Dicaprio portrayal of Jordan was a good performance?
Yeah, I think so. But Dicaprio is not for comedy  movie, in my opinion.
Was the movie very funny?
I wasn't sure what the genre " black comedy" referred to
There are some scene that it is funny, example is when DiCaprio is scamming other people.
so it took place in the past, 1987?
Yes, it took place on 1987.
You can ask me more about the movie. Don't be shy.
do you generally watch " black comedy" type of movies?
No, honestly this is the only kind of black movie that I've watched.
I mean black comedy.
did you think the characters were dull?
When it comes to acting skills, I think they are not dull. Most of them are good actors.
Based on the paragraph , it sounds like Jordan was really smart to pull off the scheme that he did
22 million in 3 hours is CRAZY
are you there?
Hello
Did you see Zootopia?
I did, it was great.
What did you think of Judy?
I am not sure who that is
She is the main character, a bunny that becomes a police officer.
Okay, I see. Yeah, I thought she was cool. I liked the sloth
He was good but I also grew to like the fox towards the end.
It got a 98 on rotten tomatoes. That is very impressive
That's very high, probably because it is so likeable and funny
The story is really good
Did you see that NIck was bullied as a child?
Which character is Nick?
He is the fox that eventually starts working with Judy, the main character.
Okay, I don't remember him being bullied
On IMDB, it didn
t get as high of a rasting
It was when he was younger and he tried joining the Ranger scouts, they stereotyped him because he was a fox.
*rating
Okay. 
It is still a pretty high rating, ecsepcially for an animated movie.
I agree. I didn't know it was that high
I like that Judy asks Nick to be his partner.
her partner*
I see it had two directors as well
I didn't notice that
There were a lot of suspenseful moments in the movie
Yes there was but I think it was so well liked because of all the characters, it was relatable.
I agree
What do you think was the nest part of the movie?
I liked towards the end when they start working together to out the mayor.
Hello, I'd love to know the name of the movie
Hello, the movie is Zootopia
It is described as a brilliantly well-rounded film that is funny smart and thought provoking
I have not see zootopia but frozen yes
I don't have kids, but the will start coming soon :)
I would highly recommend you watch the film Zootopia because it received a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 98%
did you get access to the documents about the movie?
oh wow 98% is good
Yes I did get access to documents about Zootopia
but the problem i have with these movies..they usually potray things that are from someone's imagination
lucky you, i have to get all the information from you because it's obvious they let you access so that I can ask all the questions?
Any elements of LGBT freedom in it? because I realize most movies now a days potray LBGT  freedom
oh thats good, seems to be well made and researched 
Yes, indeed they do. But the positive aspect about the movie Zootopia, is that although it is all imaginary, the film carries a message of acceptance that is thought-provoking
music helps to keep the vibes real
ok.nice chatting with u
Yes, also the cast of the film includes Idris Elba, Ginnifer Goodwin
Directions stated we talk for 20 min. I am supposed to convince you to watch the film
Hello

That's a good cast
He normally plays really creepy bad  guys
Haha totally
 Looks like monster Hunter has something like fraternity or sorority games called scary games 
 Oops monsters University Iâve been playing monster Hunter sorry 
 Maybe itâs to teach kids to challenge themselves 
Oops did I lose you
Hi

A 2011 movie

It is more of Science/Sport movie

I would recommend you go see it anytime you are free
thanks for the info..
it is totally fiction though
catch you later dear friend
Have you ever seen How to Train Your Dragon?
Yes, I have it is a lovely movie
It is an animation/fantasty movie that came out in 2010. 
Yes it is , actually a movie I really enjoy. 
Which character do you like best?
It is animation that is voiced by Jay Baruchel (Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III) and  Gerard Butler ( Stoick the Vast),
The movie has everything, from 3D computer-animation, to action-fantasty
It is a DreamWorks Animation that was distributed by Paramount Pictures
Did you know that the movie was actually loosely based on a British book series?
Yes
and alot different that the actual books
the books are more comedy 
intersting, I did not know that.
Did you like the interactions with the characters?
Oh yes, very much
which character do you like the most?
The movie is based at the Isle of Berk in a remote Viking village where there of often Dragons stealing livestock and causing toruble  
I like Astrid and Gobber
Toothless is my favorite dragon
Toothless is a great character. Hiccup was supposed to kill him in the beginning but couldn't bring himself to do it and instead sets him free
He gradually tames the dragon and calls him toothless because of his retractable teech
It was becuase of toothless that Hiccup learned how to tame other dragons
Do you think Hiccup cheats because of what he learns from Toothless ? (by using it his training class?)
He become proficient in subduing the captive dragons, i don't know how much you can call that cheating
But he wouldn't have known that without having Toothless. 
so maybe just an advantage not cheating 
How do you feel about how Stoick treats Hiccup?
Stoick leaving Hiccup, but then arriving home unscucessful and finding how Hiccup had trained the dragons led to a celebration
i mean throughout the whole movie. he was rather harsh to him in the beginning
Stoick uses Hiccup when Hiccups accidently reveals that Toothless can locate the dragon's nest. Stoick disowns his son
That to me is very harsh
However, when Hiccup almost drowns trying to free toothless, Stoick saves them both, reconciling with his son
Did you like the ending? how they make Hiccup and Toothless basically equal? (both missing something vital?)
How do you feel about the rotten tomatoes 98% score?
Yes, when Hiccup wakes up on Berk, his lower left leg is missing and he is using a prothesis, so he and toothless are the same
I thought a 98% was a good score on rotton tomatoes
Hello
Hi
So the movie we're talking about is Inception
Have you seen it?
What is the movie about? I haven't seen it
The movie is a scientific movie about people who infiltrate the subconscious of individuals and obtain information in the dream world. Basically they enter into someone's dreams to find out information.
Seems like an interesting movie, have you watched it?
Yeah, I've seen it. It's directed by Christopher Nolan if you've heard of him.
I think he also directed The Dark Knight among other things
Inception also has a rotten tomatoes score of 86% which is really high.
I love his movies, his a pretty good director, what about the cast of the movie?
Leonardo DiCaprio is in it along with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy. All pretty big names.
Yeah, pretty good actors. 
I like their movies as well
sounds like a good combination
what about the other movie ratings?
IMDB rates it 8.8/10
Which is also pretty high I think
Do you want to know more of the plot or a scene?
Yeah it seems like a high rating, what was your favorite scene?
So there's this scene where multiple people are going into a dream. So they need to have someone "kick" them awake at the same time to escape. However, someone gets wounded in the dream  and are almost dying and they get sent into "limbo".
and what happens if the die in the dream? what are the consequences of this
They basically are stuck there until someone can wake them up in the real world. So in the movie, even though it was only a few hours of real time, two of the characters spent fifty years in the "limbo" world, where they had to construct it based on their shared memories.
And whats the role of Leonardo Di Caprio in this film?
Im guessing he has the leading role
Yeah he's the lead actor. His name is Dom Cobb and he specializes in conning secrets from victims in their dreams.
One more thing about the "limbo" world is that eventually people forget that the world they are in is not real.
So they can't distinguish between a dream and what is real.
Even when they "wake up" in a dream, they are still in the dream even if they don't realize it.
Seems like a really interesting concept
Im getting interested in the movie
so far the plot seems great and the cast seems pretty good as well
also the director
Yeah it's a pretty quality movie
I can tell you more about the plot if you want?
Yeah, that would be great
tell me more about it
So there are things called totems
They basically are an object that reminds someone that they are dreaming
something that roots them to the real world
Interesting, I think I will give the movie a chance and watch it, It seems worth my while.
I hope that Morgan Freeman is actually G-d in reality, if there is one.
Yeah same here, looks like Rotten Tom atoes and Metacritic didn't score the movie very well...
I've never heard of CinemaScore but they seem to think highly of it
I'm more familiar with Rotten Tomatoes. But they do say Jim Carrey is hilarious  in this movie 
I've never heard of Lisa Ann Walter, but I assume she plays Jennifer Aniston's sister or mother in this. It doesn't say if they find out if he is G-d or not
Same here, never heard of the side characters. I have no idea who Philip Baker Hall is. He isn't sharing any simiar character last name so I'm guessing he might play a friend
Do you know what it means to "get bogged down in treacle"? I don't know what to make of that review
I have no idea what that word means, but I'm assuming they are trying to say the movie lacked in substance or Carrey's acting ability? It seems the second review doesn't think Jim is a real actor "...Carrey probably nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor" Both reviews don't seem to like his acting skills....
I'd still see it given the cast. Never heard of the director though
Hello?
Hey, have you seen The Avengers? It's a pretty good movie, you should check it out if you like Robert Downey Jr.
YES, I KNOW AND ALSO I LIKE THE MOVIE
It's really great what Mark Ruffalo did as Bruce Banner/The Hulk, making him so calm yet ready to become a volcano don't you think?
Yes, I think so
I'm not always a big Joss Whedon fan, but he did a good job with the humor to spice up the team origin story. Were you surprised that it worked with so many characters?
Strictly, this may be his main potential
I would say Robert Downey Jr. is also playing to his potential here, with his sharp tongue and sophistication. Who was your favorite character?
Robert Downey is my favorite favorite CHARACTER
Did you think he made a good leadership figure of the Avengers or did anybody else stand out to you more that way?
No, he is right
That opening with the Tesseract escape was pretty cool, setting the tone for the movie.
MAY BE  That was the reason for the film's success
Yeah, it was pretty surprising when Hawkey got enslaved so early in the movie though.
It refers to   image capture skills
PLEASE CHAT ME FAST
I'm not sure about that, but Nick Fury is always so cool. Too bad the bad guys always have to get one up on them.
It's their nature and it's impossible
I guess so. I wonder what the deal is with the leader of those Chitauri? Very mysterious.
It was a mystery to the last
For this film at least I guess. It was pretty sad when Coulson died. Did that scene get you?
There is a glimpse of seeing
Yeah, a t least it brought the Avengers together finally, no need for them to be fighting each other the whole time.
There is no need
Absolutely. Beat on Loki, like the Hulk did. Who kicked the most butt do you think?
I think so
I loved that Hulk saved Iron Man when he was falling, such a great moment.
I like Hulk too
Yeah he's the best. It's great that the whole team had to work together to save the day in the end, don't you think?
I knew and I thought
There were certainly some high stakes with that nuclear missile heading for New York.
Hello. So you read a document about a movie?
still  reading
yep!
Alright. So what's the movie called?
Iron Man!
It's a superhero film - do you like comics?
I do. I get real into them and try to dig up as much info as I can. 
Do you know who the villain will be?
Obadiah Stone, who is Tony Stark's second in command in Stark Industries. Turncoat who tries to overtake the company!
Alright, so a more down to earth super hero movie than some. No super aliens or anything like that?
yeah, I  like superhero films that rely more on technology and skill than superpowers - feels more within the realm of possibility. Critics describe this as having a military thriller feel, as opposed to a stylized comic book frame by frame replay.
no super aliens; grenades, terrorists, and electromagnetic exosuits!
and a hint of romance, too; Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Tony Stark (Ironman's) potential love interest.
This movie has something for everyone! I highly recommend it :)
Since it's just called "Iron Man" with no secondary title I'm guessing probably an origin story?
Good guess! It' s the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, actually.
Interesting. Since it's the first how is the budget? Do special effects suffer at all?
don't know about the budget - but critical response is that it's an "expansively entertaining special effects extr avaganza"
with relatively seamless CGI
Alright cool. You mentioned Pepper Potts actress; Who else is starring?
Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man; Jeff Bridges as his nemesis, and Terrance Howard as James "Rhodey" Rhodes.
I don't know James Rhodes. Who is he, in the general scheme of things?
He is a friend of Tony Stark's - he is liaison between Stark Industries and the military, because Lt. Colonel  Rhodes is in the US Air Force in the weapons development / acquisitions dept, and Stark Industries is a defense contractor.
What kind of weapons is Stark Industries selling to the air force?
Power armor?
nope 
rocket propelled grenades
I see.
Well I think I've got a pretty good picture of the movie now.
Any last thoughts?
do you think you'd enjoy it? Do you want to go see it?
Definitely. That kind of movie is right up my alley.
Just that while critics do vary in response, a 94% rating is pretty decent! A from cinema score and 79/100 on Metacritic
That is very impressive. Thank you for time!
Hello there!
hey
So tell me a little bit about this movie :)
have you seen the movie frozen?
I actually have not...but I've heard let it go too many times for comfort.
How do you feel about the movie? Care to share a little bit?
They say its the best animated movie Disney has put out since Beauty and the beast
I think it was a great movie. The songs are adorable. good for kids. even the critics liked it
Hmm I think I'll have to check it out. So I can at least say that I've seen it then ! :)
yes. its a story of two princesses. Elsa and Anna
Who doesn't like princesses? Whats the story line like?
Princess Elsa has magic powers but is insecure about since she injured her sister when they wonder. It became to much and she ran away
Well that's depressing
Their parent died and Ana has to find her sister so they can run the country together. 
So what's the storyline?
Well Elsa runs away after their parents died. Ana goes on this journey to find her sister and help her sister control her magic so they can return home. Its a cute movie for the kids
Sounds interesting. Maybe I'll kidnap one of my nieces or nephews and.watch it with them. Thanks! 
They will love it. Theres even a love story within the plot as well. Everyone loves a prince and princess love story
Haha I guess that's true. I do prefer realism but I do appreciate that Disney throws in adult concepts in children's stories that go right over children's heads
haha yeah they always do that dont they
Rented it online. It's a party!
lol almost makes me want to watch it again
So, now I guess we just hang out until they let us proceed! Let it good!
Let it go* ... Lame.
haha. As much as ive heard the movie songs I still enjoy it from time to time
I just remember my niece's birthday. Must've heard that song 200 times...in a row
Me too. I like the charatcter Olaf. I see him everywhere. Hes a talking snowman. he becomes one of their friends. very cute
There can only be one neighborhood snowman, and that's Frosty! :O
lol Frosty is a classic. But olaf  is really small so Frosty stil has that title
Hello. what is the movie?
Hey, t he movie we got is The Imitation Game
What is it about?
It is a biography of about Alan Turing, a British cryptanalyst who decrypted German intelligence codes during World War 2.
Who is the lead actors?
The lead actors are Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley
Do they successfully decrypt the code?
I am not sure if they successfully decrypt the code, I would assume so otherwise I doubt it would be as historically relevant.
Okay. What kind of movie is it? Thriller? Drama? Comedy?
It is a drama
Any other known actors in it?
Yeah, there is Matthew Goode and Tom Goodman-Hill in the movie as well.
How long is the movie?
I am not sure how long the movie is, if I had to guess I'd say 2 hours.
What year was it released originally ?
It was originally released in 2014.
Did it win any awards?
It doesn't mention winning any awards, however it has amazing reviews from different organizations.
Can you tell me more about the reviews?
The film received a CinemaScore of A+ as well as a Rotten Tomatoes review of 91%.
There are quite a few key scenes throughout the movie that are relevant  as well.
Relevant to what?
To the story. One of them explains how the main character, Alan Turing is unhappy in his boarding school due to bullying. It is through that unhappiness that he found his interest in cryptography.
I 'm quite interested in the movie. Anything else you want to tell me?
I don't want to give too much away, but there is a few points where characters are revealed as spys and release important information about the main character.
Ph, spy. i love spy.
I do too. Also, there are a lot of secrets within the movie about the main character as well that are incredibly important to the story.
But I can't say
How did it do in the box office?
I don't have any specifics, but based off the reviews of the film I would say very well.
What else do you know about the movie?
I know that it has been regarded as one of the most important stories of the last century.
Who is the director?
There is some controversy however with the film, like some people are upset due to misrepresentation of facts and rearranging things to make a better story.
The director was Morten Tyldum.
Is it because the lead character is gay?
I don't know if it has to due with him being gay, more so the order at which events were revealed misrepresented the work that Turning did at Bletchley Park.
Thanks. It's nice chatting with you.
You too!
Hi
what is the name of the movie?
Bruce Almighty 
what is the movie about
The movie is about a tv reporter who complains about Gods presence in his life guidance and so is offered the chance to do his job for one week
That sounds interesting.
It is a well written comedy, have you seen it?
 It features an all star cast of Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman, Lisa Ann Walker and Phillip Baker Hall. 
Not the whole thing just bits and pieces.
I like comedies with Jim Carrey in them
I have seen Even Almighty it similar to that one?
me too! 
I am not sure I at liberty to disclose that lol?
re: the rules
Ok
but  I will tell you a little more about the movie
ok that would be great
I keep meaning to watch it but seem to always forget
So Carreys character, Bruce Nolan, is a reporter. Hardworking, but not very successful. He has a lot of bad luck and reaches his limit when his co worker receives a promotion over him
He then starts his complaints to God who ends up responding with the proposition that gives him his powers
So its like walk in someone else's shoes to see what they have to deal with.
More as in "why God leaves some prayers unanswered"
oh ok
Bruce starts responding with yeses to all the prayers he receives, and as you can imagine that's were a lot of the conflict AND comedy come in to play
I enjoy comedy that is funny but has a good story line.
oh yea this one definetly has both and then the story to with Jennifer Annistons character as well
Would you recommend this movie?
oh yea 
From what you have said about Bruce Almighty it seems like a very good movie.
I actually forgot about it, and how well written it is now that I really think about it
its a bit of a tear jerker too lol
I am looking forward to adding it to my list of movies to watch.
I like feel good movies but do cry easy during movies that are tear jerkers.
I would add this one, its worth watching
I hope my movie store has it.
also seems to be a bit of a classic especially with it being Jim Carrey
or I will have to find someone that does.
I have netflix I will check there
Thank you for telling me about this movie I appreciate it.
you still have a movie store lol which one??
Family Video
Its the only one in town
I don't believe Netflix has it, but worth checking
also red box..
oh yes, we have one too I forgot about that
oh yeah i forgot about red box
they should have it, again it is a classic
either of them might and youre welcome!
I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
hello
Hi, Do you think  this movie earned its 92& rotten tomatoes rating?
Yes, I think it did, it was a great movie.  What do you think of Robert Downey Jr in that role?
hi
Hey, what do you think about Despicable Me?  It's a really good movie.
I think so too.
It's quite funny!
Did you just read about it? Or have you seen it also.
Yeah?  Steve Carell is super funny.  My kids love this movie.
Yeah he plays gru really well.
I've seen it.
Oh, I don't have kids, but I think the movie is good for all ages
I recommend it to my friends.
Lots of good lessons in it
Same here
And the animation is really top level.
Yeah it is, simple but not too simple, and just detailed enough
I like all the small details in the movie, and how gru evolves over time
what's your favorite character in the movie?
I also like Gru.  He's the funniest of the characters by far.
Same here. And it has a lot of rewatching value
Always find new things and easter eggs
Yeah I've probably seen it a dozen times.
hi
Hello, any thoughts on Iron Man?
for me it is an excellent movie of the superhero genre
I would agree. I particularly like Robert Downey Jr. in this role, it's as though he spent his entire adult life preparing for the role of Tony Stark.
it's as if he really was tony hehehej
Right, I couldn't have picked a better franchise to kick off the marvel cinematic universe. 
Despite the futuristic technology, the series stayed rooted in realism for years.
Do you have any thoughts about Jon Favreau's creative decision to update the setting to Iraq from the comic's canonical Vietnam War setting?
Do you have any thoughts at all?
Are you capable of any response whatsoever?
Do you agree with the rating of the movie?
I liked Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane. He played the role in a way that led the audience to trust him until his true motivations became apparent.
You're a very stand-offish robot.

Hello! How are you doing?
I'm not able to see the document that we will be discussing. Do you mind telling me what movie it is that we will be talking about?
I don't mean to pester you, but could you please confirm that you are receiving my messages?
I'm sorry, but I am going to have to abort the conversation within the next couple of minutes if I don't receive a response from you.
It has now been five minutes since we began this chat. If I have not heard from you within the next minute, I will have to abort this conversation. I am sorry for any inconvenience that this may cause for you.
It is a film directed by Steven Spielberg in 2002 it's a bio graphical crime about the character named Frank Abagnale Whom at a young age ran away from home to commit fraud 
What is the name of the film?
Catch me if you can
I don't think I've ever seen that, but I do remember hearing about it. Have you seen it?
Yes I've seen it and is very good film
It definitely sounds interesting. I will definitely watch it at some point. Why does the character run away from home?
It is starring Leonardo Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank Abignale whom is a master at check fraud and Tom Hanks is the FBI agent who chases him
Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks are both incredible actors. What is his reason for running away from home to commit fraud?
He's running away from the character the Tom Hanks plays as the FBI agent agent who is trying to catch up who's trying to catch him for check fraud, Leonardo DiCaprio poses as a pan am American pilot
Now that you mention it, I remember seeing the trailer for this and really wanting to see it.
Yeah it's definitely a very suspense field film and if you like Leonardo DiCaprio you will very much enjoy this film
Any film that I've ever seen with him in it was really good. It's ironic that you mention him because for some reason, I've been in the mood to watch Titanic.
Has another movie now shown up on your end for us to discuss?
This movie was really good I think it should have earned Leonardo DiCaprio the Oscar that he will deserves. This movie is definitely well watching it has Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio and it is very suspense field and will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole
No other than that you mentioned titanic
I like movies that keep me on the edge and that are suspenseful.
Which titanic is one of my favorite Leonardo DiCaprio movies ever
I think you would really enjoy this movie and you should give it a watch
Me, too. I also really like Black Diamond. Catch Me If You Can will absolutely be the next movie that I watch.
I have never seen black diamond does that also star Leonardo DiCaprio
Do you know if Leonardo DiCaprio was nominated for an Oscar for this movie?
Oh, I'm sorry. I meant Blood Diamond. Blood Diamond does star Leonard Dicaprio, yes.
The only movie that I know of that Leonardo DiCaprio was nominated for Oscar wasThe movie named revenant
Oh yes I have seen blood diamond in that was a very good movie as well
Gotcha. I think he deserves a lot more than that.
I agree it is sad that it took them this long to actually earn his Oscar although the movie the revenant was quite
Amazing
I agree as well. Given that Catch Me If You Can was released in 2002, I doubt he'll earn an Oscar for that. Any time that I see that a movie will be starring him or even that he'll be in, I'm always interested in watching it.
Yes me as well he's a very good actor and deserves a lot more credit than what he has gotten
If you are a Leonardo DiCaprio fan I suggest you also watch a film he starred in called inception
I completely agree. You have definitely convinced me to watch Catch Me If You Can. Thank you for providing me with all of the information about it. Do you happen to know if it is available on Netflix?
I've actually seen Inception, and it is a great movie!
I wish it was available on Netflix but I'm not very sure that it is I have rented it from my movie store that is close to my home
Okay. Well, thank you for all of the information. It looks like we are finished up with our chat. Thank you again for providing me with the information about the movie! Have a great night.
Yes inception is a great film and Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon Levitt star in that film
I know. I love them both, and I love that movie.
Hi
This movie is about how Facebook got started by Mark Zuckerberg, it's called "The Social Network". Interesting to watch because it's based on real events.
I have heard of that movie before
Although I haven't watched it before
It was more popular than the book it was based on, The Accidental Billionaires, probably because it's a tale of Sex, Money, and Betrayal. Stuff we can all identify with
Oh that is really interesting
It makes it sound more intriguing than before
Have you seen it
Yes, we've all heard of Facebook, but the story of how it got started is pretty surprising. I didn't believe everything I saw in the movie, but it held my interest
I think sometimes they add information to movies just to keep the audience entertained
Which is understandable because you don't want a boring movie 
I had no idea it was a book thogh
No doubt, It is a drama. Zuckerberg and the current staff weren't involved in making the movie, it has a kind of dark irony, but one of the founders, Eduardo Saverin, was consulted by the book's author. 
I am sure there is information that they didn't want to leak in the movie and even the book
So would you recommend seeing this movie? It a couple of years old if not older. 
Yes, it's an engaging look at that time period when websites were just getting started. Some of the lawsuits that came out of those beginnings might still be on going. 
I believe it. I remember reading about the lawsuits when they were filed. I think they have great lawyers to protect themselves though...
The film starts in 2003 when Zuckerberg was a 19 year old student at Harvard. He actually created a campus website called Facemash that allowed users to rate the attractiveness of photos of female students.
That is a really good overall description for someone who wants a synapse  of the movie. 
Oh, that's just the beginning. That website was so popular it got the attention of the Winklevoss twins, who were upper class men who made a dating website exclusive to Harvard.  So the origins of the idea for the site are kind of vague  
Is the company protected by a patent or some kind of legal documents?
I don't know, but Zuckerberg was given 6 months academic probation for hacking into college databases and crashing the Harvard computer network. So he's aware of what kind of damage a rogue programmer can do.
As a programmer I could see the damage that can be done by hacking into databases and networks.
damage was bound to happen in this situation
So you also know that programming knowledge doesn't necessarily translate to business smarts. It's when Zuckerberg gets hooked up with Napster co-founder Sean Parker that the business really starts to take off
I had totally forgotten about using Napster. I use to always use it. Had no idea he co-f ounded it.
There were other social networks before The Facebook, too, which is what Zuckerberg called it while expanding the site to Yale, Columbia, and Stanford. I liked Napster, too, and had a MySpace account.  But that all changed after Parker suggested they drop 'The' and move Facebook to Palo Alto. 
I I also had a MySpace account but haven't logged in roughly  2 years. 
Been a while for me, too.  Parker ended up sharing a house in Palo Alto with Zuckerberg, leaving his partner Saverin in New York to work on "Business Development". Meanwhile they were developing plans for the business in California to make a billion dollar company. 
That is crazy. To have potentially in a company to make a billion dollar company is mind blowing
Well, Saverin and the Winklevoss twins tried to keep their interests in the company. The film is intercut with scenes from their depositions in the cases against Zuckerberg. They eventually settled out of court because Zuckerberg's defense thinks he will appear unsympathetic to a jury.
Well if he wasn't going to seem unsympathetic  than maybe it was the best choice for the defense 
No doubt, the film has lots of sordid details about the founding and the callous attitude Zuckerberg had towards his collaborators. But the end, when he's sending a friend request, is when it get's really weird. 
Ugh I hate endings that either leave cliff hangers or just ends with no explanation of the future events
I hear you. This ending has to deal with a world where Superman is absent, and after every one leaves, the dirt on top of Clark's coffin starts rising into the air. How about that!
Thanks!
hey
so are we ready to talk about this movie?
Yes..
Ok well overall I thought this movie was pretty good.
Its very action movie, I like this movie so much 
yea, it actually does a nice job of giving all of the characters stuff to do and doesn't feel like to much is going on
Yes., Its all are done a good job..I Saw this movie in  4 times..
ive seen it quite a few times also
okay,,.who is director of the movie??
joss whedon
he doesn't do marvel movies now he's moved on
Okay thanks for your information..
no problem, i feel like this movie really launched chris hemsworth as a big deal 
Yes sure..Its really big deal on Chris hemsworth
i also think this movie has kind of served as a template for newer super hero movies
the all star cast really helped too 
not sure you could do a movie better than this one for this style
Yeah..but previous super hero acting is very well and adorable..
well all depends on the movie
this movie also may have done the best job out there on getting the hulk right
Yes..Hulk act is marvelous in this movie
it also does a nice job of making iron man a leader
overall just a really good display of the characters
Yes..Its all super heroes action equally displayed
yea it works out pretty well
i feel like this is kind of the super hero movie that does it all right
Yes.. really 
hopefully they keep getting it right
Yeah..when you watch this movie??
Hey there
hello
How are you 
I am good how are you?
Thank you i am fine 
Have you seen the movie 
Its a great movie 
Yes I have seen it, and I found it quite good. It wasn't your typical Disney live-action, but it is due to this that it was great. definitely surpassed the ideas seen in Frozen.
Lol
The movie Maleficent is also a great look at the untold story of Sleeping Beauty
Yes its true
Well sleeping beauty its an old movie bud really good
I think the new ones are excellent as well
So very true. I just like the digital look of the fairytale setting that plays off the original animated scenery.
Are you a fan lf disney movies?
This movie did cause me to loathe King stefan though... I mean he tore her wings off.
I like pirates of the Caribbean more than all the other Disney'
Yes and No. I find that the animated films are quite nostalgic, but the live-action films like Maleficent in which you see the darkness behind the films cater better to me nowawdays.
True i think you are a good movie reader
Though I do find the Jerry Burckheimer productions better than Robert Stromberg who did Maleficent 
Yes you are correct 
But Maleficent has a far more heartbreaking background than the Pirates movies.the background of Maleficent, and even the fact taht she cared for Aurora despite her villian status makes her likeable and hateable at the same time
Which ones are your favorite movies animated or action 
How many times have you seen this movie
I quite have not seen the whole movie
I like the action ones best I think. and ive only seen Maleficent once.... while the storyline was great, I am not complelled to watch it again. 
Yes me too 
what parts have you seen
To be honest i dont really remember much
I mean I do give them credit for the live-action of the whole Phillip rescuing Aurora from Maleficent thing, but even with computers and the live-action, none of it did justice to the animated version where she turns into the dragon
plus they added a darker element where King Stefan also falls to his death
Well i do remember that part
Are you into movies critics 
I find this movie confuses me lol. You're happy she gets her wings back, but mad Aurora's dad died... or is that good too? He wasn't bad in the animated version.
Eh I do take looks at Rotten Tomatoes here and there
they hated this movie by the way lol 
You seen to well know much about the whole production kind 
Lol
hi
see any good movies lately?
hello?
Hey! Not really, I just Batman vs. Superman. The 27% Rotten Tomatoes score is fitting.
oh, i havent seen that one, tell me more
why was it so bad?
Well, it's the sequel to Man of Steel. There's a lot of meaningless action and not much else.
Hi. Just looking at this now.
Hola, ando leyendo
Who played Hawkeye?
hey let me remember that
What role did Robert Downey Jr play?
Ok, so I am looking for Robert Downey Jr. 's role and who played Hawkeye. Do you know? 
is one of the main characters of the plot
Do you know who wrote and directed 'The Avengers?'
 Stan Lee and  Jack Kirby
Joss Whedon
The publisher Marvel Comics
oh !
Do you know the Rotten Tomatoes score?
no, tell me about that
tell me that you know about this movie
92% with an average of 8/10 interesting
Do you know who Thor's brother is in this film?
really no, i dont know tell me that
Loki. The team of Captain America, The Hulk, and Thor, along with Iron Man are trying to stop Loki.
you here?
Mark Ruffalo played the Hulk. Did yo know that?
ah, I understand it's quite complex and the three main characters have a mission
I liked the movie because of the mission you mention. Did you like it?
I'm just reading about it
Ok
I'm really interesting and it's a classic
I guess a wormhole opened to let Loki through to the Earth.
The wormhole is called aTesseract. That's hard to say and spell.
that hole that he found was quite exciting
A movie critic said the the Hulk was played like he was a reservoir of calm but then became a Volcano. I agree.
143 minutes for a movie is long these days
are you there and reading the document. Tell me about your impression of how long the movie is please
i understand
why let chat
just i lose my conexion
Hey, have you seen The Avengers? It's a pretty good movie, you should check it out if you like Robert Downey Jr.
YES, I KNOW AND ALSO I LIKE THE MOVIE
It's really great what Mark Ruffalo did as Bruce Banner/The Hulk, making him so calm yet ready to become a volcano don't you think?
Yes, I think so
I'm not always a big Joss Whedon fan, but he did a good job with the humor to spice up the team origin story. Were you surprised that it worked with so many characters?
Strictly, this may be his main potential
I would say Robert Downey Jr. is also playing to his potential here, with his sharp tongue and sophistication. Who was your favorite character?
Robert Downey is my favorite favorite CHARACTER
Did you think he made a good leadership figure of the Avengers or did anybody else stand out to you more that way?
No, he is right
That opening with the Tesseract escape was pretty cool, setting the tone for the movie.
MAY BE  That was the reason for the film's success
Yeah, it was pretty surprising when Hawkey got enslaved so early in the movie though.
It refers to   image capture skills
PLEASE CHAT ME FAST
I'm not sure about that, but Nick Fury is always so cool. Too bad the bad guys always have to get one up on them.
It's their nature and it's impossible
I guess so. I wonder what the deal is with the leader of those Chitauri? Very mysterious.
It was a mystery to the last
For this film at least I guess. It was pretty sad when Coulson died. Did that scene get you?
There is a glimpse of seeing
Yeah, a t least it brought the Avengers together finally, no need for them to be fighting each other the whole time.
There is no need
Absolutely. Beat on Loki, like the Hulk did. Who kicked the most butt do you think?
I think so
I loved that Hulk saved Iron Man when he was falling, such a great moment.
I like Hulk too
Yeah he's the best. It's great that the whole team had to work together to save the day in the end, don't you think?
I knew and I thought
There were certainly some high stakes with that nuclear missile heading for New York.
HI

Hello
HEy
Whats up
Just saw a movie based on a DC Comics character!
Cool! Which character is it?
Wonder Woman played by Gal Gadot.
Great action film, have you seen it?
No! I really wanted to see it but didn't get a chance yet!
Is it still in the theaters? I'll probably check it out once its available on iTunes
Very entertaining and not the grim dark and sloppy film they sometimes have done.
Nice! haha
Basically a war flick. Gotta love a good Amazon princess movie.
Have you heard anything about when its available on iTunes?
More about her internal battles than the WWI battles. very engaging
mm hmm I've seen the action scene only in batman vs superman
She relies on love to stop war.
is it as good as that scene? have you seen batman vs superman?
Can't hold a good warrior woman down! They tried to forbid her from training but as it turns out, they needed her.
Not sure why it got poor reviews. neat element of mystery too. She was raised on a hidden island for Amazon warrior women.
I haven't seen that movie. sorry I can't compare
sorry, I don't know when it's available on iTunes and missed that question earlier.
Do you watch many movies that way?
I prefer the theaters, but I have a new born so I can't really go to the theaters for a few months! lol
Itunes are okay, but I'd rather watch things on netflix or amazon prime.
Or even better, if direcTV plays them for free, I'll totally watch it
I understand that. I really like the scene in the movie where she receives a photographic plate of herself and some gues from WWI which makes her recall her past. Adds some mystery.
How old is wonderwomen anyways lol
Has she been around for awhile?
Would you say there was a lot of story ? or was it mostly action scenes?
I have no idea how old she is!?! It was a great balance of action and storyline.
haha 
hope I can watch it soon!
is there a part 2 to the movie?
She has a cool "Godkiller" sword she tries to use to kill Ares but he ends up destroying it and making a big revelation to her. (I don't want to spoil the plot so not going to tell you).
Would you watch it again?
?
yeah please don't spoil it 
lol
Yes I would watch it again. Not sure about the part 2, I don't think so at least not yet.
That Ares character likes to throw his influence around.
I can not believe the movie did not get higher rating it was funny
I completely agree. The punch lines were great.
Russell Brand was a great choice to play Dr. Nefario.
I totally agree
did you see the movie in 3d it was really good
It's definitely a movie for all ages. 
I saw it in 3d in the theater and have seen it many times in it's regular format at home.
It is a favorite among my children.
this is kind of hard there is only so much you can talk about
I agree. 
The paragraphs give you limited information to talk about, it's much easier to speak of personal experiences with this movie.
I am glad the movie at least recieved an A score for CinemaScore. 
yeah I agree ,
The moon thing was funny
The moon thing was hilarious. 
It's such a great and ridiculous super villian idea.
well you know you can not trust the banker he is paying to steal the moon
Very true. I love that it's the Bank of Evil. That cracks me up. It's perfect for the movie.
I also really enjoyed Vector as a villain. Stealing the pyramid was hilarious.
I like pixar fims
I do too. They are generally as amusing for adults as they are kids.
I love the scene when the girls interrupt the video chat. It's so typical of kids.
hey the play with the girls with the cookies at vectors house was smart
It was such a great idea.  Perfect ploy.
oh the theme park was funny 
I loved seeing Gru really develop love for the girls over time. It was very adorable and heart warming.
you just knew the girls were going to interrupt the meeting their kids
I loved the scene when Gru has to rescue the girls.
oh yeah i agree
And the moon getting bigger in Vector's ship was hilarious.
I also loved all of the interactions between Dr. Nefario and any other character. They were hilarious. Russell Brand really was the perfect choice for him.
it was very touching when the girls offered the money from their piggy bank
It was. It was so sweet. And the minions were so loyal to Gru as well. It was adorable.
I was happy vector got stuck on the moon
As was I. It was an excellent way for him to end up. Fitting for how pouty and childish he was the entire time.
yead definately a spoiled child well I just counted and the conversation and it has been 15 comments we should be done with the task
Hey, what did you  think of the movie?
I like that it is a true story.
Yeah, very cool. I loved it but I like con-man films in general. Leonardo DiCaprio was great.
Did you like the movie.
The acting...Leo, Hanks, Walkin...was great.
Yeah I thought Dicaprio was great. But I think Tom Hanks made the movie super good.
Yeah. And your true story point is good. I wonder what the real Frank Abagnale is like.
Supposibly just like the character played by Dicaprrio.
He must be funny. Movie was a crack-up. Very easy to watch. 
I wonder if someone could still get away with something like that today.
Probably could become POTUS these days.
I wonder If the real guy is still alive.
Good chance he is. Movie wasn't set too long ago.
To think the guy was only 19 years old when he started.
Yeah. Scorcese is a great director. I like it when great ones take on lighter, funnier plots. No reason to be serious all the time.
Hey the guy was convincing enough to get a job with American World airways.
Probably helps that he was young. You're braver and more confident at that age.
He was also young when he went to prison.
It is really great that the FBI hired him as a investigator years later.
The twist of ending up working for the FBI is great. Reminds me of JFK's dad. He made a fortune insider trading (it was not illegal at the time) and then FDR made him the first commisioner of the SEC, where he was great at busting insider traders.
Yes. It is almost the same story.
I like Martin Sheens role.
Everyone's a sucker for redemption flicks. This film must have made a fortune. 
Wellhe made a fortune in the movie.
People say the real guy made a lot of money inventing new ways of stopping cons.
Makes sense.
Everyone loves a happy ending too.
Sort of reminds me of Forest Gump.
DId you stay for the ending? They reveal the real guy then.
During the credits, I mean.
OH Yeah. Saw the photo of the real guy.
A real good movie. 
Hi! I've really enjoyed the movie "Real Steel" It was a great movie that was full of adventure!
I've seen this one before
seems kinda like a typical family-action film with some scifi elements
was kinda cool tho
Yes it is sort of the family type of film. But I got very much into the characters especially Hugh Jackman's.
was interesting to see Hugh play a more domestic role 
normally he's always a loner fighter type
Yes but  he played it well and was able to pull it off.
yeah he played the struggle of the character well
I always find it interesting to see what sort of demands actors can get into. I think he fit in with everyone else really well.
yeah the unusual mix of actors led to a coherent mixture 
That's definitley true.
I enjoyed seeing all of the different robot fighters in the movie s well.
the new paragraph loaded reminds me of how interesting the factor that these robots were an everyday thing in the movie's world
like he's just a lower-class dude but he owns a fighting robot
Yeah seeing the draw of their world and how these robots are just sort of common was something that I really liked as well.
I thought about what it would be like to really live in that world
also interesting how it brings up the point that improved technology doesn't make all problems go away
this guy still is in debt and so on
Yes no matter what we have basic life issues will never really change. They'll just come about in a new way.
that was a pretty good scene (the new paragraph)
kind of hinted at things remaining worse for the guy/son but eventually they fought their way back
cool to see the human spirit reflected in robots
Oh yeah lol I remember that...
It's just the classic underdog story told in a somewhat different way. There will always be trials and triumphs
As long as humans are around we'll never really intrinsically change .
yeah the robots don't change the human life, they just augment it
nothing intrinsic is lost
Right. I suppose in many ways we were really supposed to see the robots as humans - more so than the actual humans. That's a really  interesting concept, I think.
kinda reminds me of virtual reality
humanity lives on but through the robots
even though the robots are doing the action their action is still fully human
Yeah that's very true. I would love it if someday we could really have virtual reality like that. It would be so much fun to be able to really feel like you're a super hero!
yeah, you'd have the thrill of a suernatural existence without losing your humanity
i think that's a nice message the film has
Right that is very true. We're all interconnected in this world somehow. Even if some people do have  more than others.
Hello
Hello
Have you seen the movie Frozen?
Yes I have, I actually saw it in theatres with my Fiance at the time it came out.
Did you like it?
Yes, it is a funny animation film.
I agree. I saw it in theaters too
I enjoy almost anything that Disney produces
The critical response was pretty good I see. \
I heard they are making a second movie to follow Frozen
It only got an 89 percent on rotten tomatoes. I thought it would get a higher score.
I don't much care for review sites, I would rather watch a movie and judge it myself.
I agree with the CinemaScore of A+
Me too, I love the artwork and time that goes into animation and C.G. movies
It seems like this movie just came out. I cannot believe it was 2013 when it arrived in theaters. 
Yeah, so much attention and popularity has kept it alive in stores as toys, shows and other items.
Who is your favorite character in Frozen?
It either has to be Sven or Christophe
Kristoff*
Do you know who Kristen Bell is?
I know of her, but not familiar of her other acting jobs.
I like the villain. I thought he was funny.
Yeah, something was up when they fell for each other early in the movie between him and Anna
Olaf could be a bit much sometimes, but had some funny parts
Yeah, I did not even guess he would have been a bad guy
I think I called it during the movie and said something to my fiance about how redheads are always portrayed as badguys.
Good point. I didn't even think of that
He looks like the villian commander from the newer Star Wars movies.
What rating would you give the movie out of ten?
I think an 9, it was a great movie, even if the music is overplayed
Bye!
Have you seen this movie?
I just saw it.
Have you seen it?
No, I usually like stuff with Benedict Cumberpatch though.
It was such a thrilling movie. Based on the life of Alan Turing.
Keira Knightly slightly annoys me however.
Cumberbach was really the highlight of the film
Got good reviews, Rotten tomatoes rarely goes over 90% it seems.
Who is Alan Turing?
true. Metacritic gave them 73/100. Turing was a mathematician who was a cryptanalyst for the British during WWII against the Germans. He is famous for breaking the Enigma code.
He was outed as a spy by the police who were investigating a break in at his home.
Definitely see it if you get a chance.
Dramas tend to kind of bore me usually, with many note-worthy exceptions. I like Comedies mostly or fantasy, Sci-fi. I will check it out though, all in all i just love movies!
Sounds like an interesting fellow, will definetly give it a watch.
It is really more of an espionage movie. It is pretty exciting. I guess there is some drama with his experiences in boarding school and studying with Morcom, his mentor.
I think you will enjoy it.
Morton Tyldum is a great director.
Andrew grant and that rag science news never gets it right, if he liked it i will probably hate it.
The hollywood reporter seems to be as fond of Cumberpatch as i am.
It is kind of technical. It goes pretty in depth about his machine to break the code. He has some breakthroughs when he realizes he can program it with words he already knows. You will probably enjoy that.
Cumberbach does a great job acting.
These storys based on true stories tend to always add so much stuff to keep it interesting that it kinda distorts history in my opinion.
The bit about getting married to Keira Knightley might be annoying for you if you are not partial to her acting. I might warn you about all that.
It is interesting since the movie is based on a play based on a book based on his life. I see your point there.
I would probably enjoy the technical aspects of the film, the good acting, and even the half made up story!
I think also where it is a movie about a mathematician, it kind of helps to add in some plot elements. I think this is unusual though as his life was so interesting.
There is quite a bit of espionage involved as well. I suppose I am not spoiling it since it is history, but there is some Russian collusion involved.
If he marries Keira knightly i may be shouting at my T.V.
Big drama when Turing confronts the russians.
Yeah you might have to fast forward through the lurid romance. It is not so bad though.
She is trite, absolutely, but the director does make it work here.
also, turns out he is gay!
so she gets what she deserves.
you might actualy like it.
I didn't really get that part, but who can understand the gays?
Well, that kinda of makes it more inviting to me, Keira Nightly must be sad to find that out!
yeah I think she was pretty upset. Like I said I didn't really understand all of that. I was mostly in it for the math. What an interesting, fascinating story.
I think Turing was gay for his mentor or something, but he dies.
Sounds a bit like Beautiful mind that was a great movie, too!
Tuberculosis.
Yeah I did love Beautiful mind. I read that that guy actually was working for the government.
Talk about changing the story!
Turing's story is pretty sad. He got bullied a lot at boarding school. Seems to have affected him a lot. Too bad he wasn't able to find love. Maybe he should have gone for somebody besides Kiera Knightley!
How come you dislike her so much?
Is it because you guys used to date?
Mostly just for hogging that driftwood in Titanic ;)
Oh yeah. I have never seen that one. 
I find her Wiry, trite, and egotistical. I only enjoy those qualities in myself.
I know there is that song by celine dion.
haha that is funny. I figured that but didn't want to say.
She is kind of a walking plattitude. Kind of like Reese Witherspoon, but more indiana less texas
or something
Oh, its ok. Im not blind. However after looking at Keira Knightley for 2 hours i might be.
Still the story sounds like one of importance that should be told, ill have to tune in.
anyways she didn't ruin the movie. If anything, Turing's life ruins the movie. It's just sad he gets bullied and takes refuge in gay love. He could have just worked out, made some friends, and been happy. It is a very important story. Reminds me of the life of Charles Darwin, or Plato.
oh, I really like Reese, Not sure what that says about me.
That is funny but you don't like Kiera. 
I thought Cumberbach made a great Turing, but it would have been funnier if they cast eminem.
Fitness is very important. Im a big fan of Darwin so that makes me interested a bit more in the story.
Well, Darwin had a rough time on the beagle. He was the captain's special steward, which was a demanding job, if you know what I mean.
All of the Hollywood rags seemed to speak highly of it.
His theory of fitness was basically an analogy for his relationship to the captain and his station in life, and his feeling of evolution to a higher station in his own life. He was certainly an interesting fellow.
I seriously loved this Turing movie. You have to see it!!!
I dont usually take anything the Hollywood reporter says to heart though.
No they have their own problems. 
And what do they know about science?
Not since they gave The Big Lebowski such awful reviews.
Turing is an important guy. I'd rather see a movie about Kurt Godel or Giordano Bruno.
Or maybe a serious horror/drama about Galileo.
I think the Big Lebowski was a great film I didn't realize it had a poor critical reception.
I actually think I might write a script about the life of Galileo
Your right, because Scientifically The Big Lebowski is the best movie ever made. yet, magazines like empire and Variety pee'd on its rug.
people would love that it would make them feel smart.
actually, that makes sense.
I am actually ordained as a Dudist Priest.
You can do it online for free, and then you can legally marry people.
Go forth and Abide my son.
Indeed. I shall Abide.
oh i know, im also a member dude.
Oh nice. I knew you were coolio foolio.
there is a fun facebook page too, dudeism, check it out!
What is up with this study though? I feel we are being watched. Do you think we will be in a movie with Benjamin Cumberbach?
I will for sure check it out on the myface.
I think there should be parallel networks called myface and spacebook.
haha i use that term Myface all the time.
great minds think alike.
I once toyed with the idea of opening a coffee shop called dunkin buckstar's
but yes, they say iron knows iron
It said there would be three pages, yet we seem to be done.
anyways though, it is pretty exciting to see Turing recalibrate that machine. You will enjoy that.
did you leave?
John returns to the criminal underworld
I wonder if that was triggered by the death of his wife.
thats interesting
The movie sounds exciting
Yes very interesting
Are you a fan of Keanu Reeves?
It's an action thriller movie. I love action thrillers.
Me too. I also like mystery and adventure movies.
When do you plan on seeing the movie? or have you seen it already?
This movie deserves a follow up
I agree
revenge thrillers are intense
Yes they are.
It only only got 6.9/10 hmmm
Wow. Im surpried.
Made in 2014. Kind of old
Oh ok. Good to know.
I would have thought it was newer
I remember when the trailer came out.
It had a lot of hype around it.
Who returns to crime after the death of a loved one hmmm
No one in their right mind.
oh I should have know seeking vengence
Yeah. Revenge would be a good reason for some people.
They stole his car and killed his puppy, a gift from the dead wife.
Wow. T hats bad.
I hate torture in movies though
Yeah. Its very unpleasent.
I like action though like fighting
Yeah. Me too.
This role probably fit Keanu so well
I think so. He does well as an actor.
hello
i would love to watch this movie 
hello!
have you seen it?
Nope. But i want to. It seems very interesting and connects to most movies i have watched
so you are fan of these superhero movies as well?
yes i am 
i love the advangers movies
and the new wonder women 
Do you think Ben Affleck makes a good Batman?
I think he is a little on the odler side 
 but i still think he would be good for the part 
You will like him in this one for sure. 
sweet 
what are your thoughts about diana playing martha 
Nice little twist with the whole Kryptonite in this too
Yea I don't mind Martha at all. 
Yess!! Thats what i was thinking 
You don't like martha as a character? 
Yes I do 
Oh okay 
I do want to see this movie. Like i would like to see how the actors played the characters 
Batman rescued  here in this movie
hopefully this went all out with the acting 
 and graphics 
and just everything to be honest 
It's pretty good. It's about 153 mins long
Yes and i see it sasy that it is in between man of steel and dark night 
I liked the sneak peak of Wonder Woman in here too. 
She appears in it too?
Yes. 
It's pretty cool
That would be great 
I think Zack Snyder did a great job directing it 
I have seen a few of his moveis 
He killed it with this one 
 he does a great job with directing 
I agree with you 
Eisenberg played a good Lex Luther too 
Hello?
great movie, isnt it?
What movie are you talking about?
Monsters  University
Ah right, I've heard it is good. What did you like about it?
for sure i didnt whatch it. But According to the article It was realised by  Pixar
Did it get better reviews than the original Monsters Inc?
can you be more specific?
Monsters University is a sequel, I wondered if it is better than the first movie
unfortunately i didnt what the first
and I didnt know it was a sequel
Ok then... Does the article have any more information that you can tell me?
the critics say it a colorful movie
can you tell me what you think about that
Does it say it is suitable for children?
I haven't seen the movie yet, I'm trying to decide if I should watch it
Is it a family movie?
Oh okay
I think so
I wonder if my 4 year old would enjoy it? Maybe he's too young?
If it's colorful and funny I think he will enjoy it. Did the article say it was a funny movie too?
May be you would be afraid, because its  a monster movie
Oh is it a scary movie?
its a comedy animation so yes it is a funny movie
Phew! That sounds great then, he loves comedy animation movies. I think we'll watch it together
great
Do you know when it is released?
Or is it already on DVD?
it was realed by 2013
 so I think it is already in DVD
It might even be on Netflix already! I will check tonight!
Thanks for your help :)
Theres no problem
What is your opinion on the movie Jaws? 
To be honest, I find shark movies to be terrifying.
I can't say I blame you. The movie definitely makes that fear worse! 
Did you know that this film was based on a book?
No, I didn't. Not surprised though. Most movies tend to be. 
I do love the Jaws music though. 
Agreed, it heightens the tension and makes it scarier, but that's kind of the point.
Are you surprised at how high the rating is for the film's critic score? And if I heard the music while driving, I would think someone was coming to take me out. Haha
97% is incredibly high, I would have thought that there would be at least some people throwing low scores in there somewhere.
Do you agree that it's a "cheerfully perverse" scare movie?
That's what I thought as well. Maybe it's because it was never done before in it's time and was so different when it came out? It might be easier to "give it a pass"   And I would say it could be "cheerfully perverse" depending on the kind of movies you enjoy. 
Do you think that it "is too gruesome for children"? 
For small children, yes. I could see them having nightmares.
I definitely agree with that. I do find it odd that it is considered a "Thriller" film. 
I think it's interesting that in the key scenes it describes the economic impact on a beach town of the shark attacks. Makes you wonder if they'd cover something like that up to make more money in real life.
In today's society, I think that would absolutely be the case. Even if there was a bounty hunter hired, they would probably go, "Nothing to see here, have fun!" 
I find it interesting that they put it in a fictional "New England resort town". You would think they would've picked somewhere in California since there's so many beaches and how huge it is. 
Agreed, there typically aren't many shark attacks in New England, usually further south or on the west coast.
I can't imagine I would keep going to the beach as a tourist if lots of people kept turning up dead.
I agree. The movie is kind of silly the more you think about it. Especially when people keep believing the town and beach team that everything is fine. Yet people keep dying? I guess they want you to suspend disbelief. Haha. 
Or you would think that tourists would join in on the bounty to make the money. 
I wasn't aware that there were so many different types of sharks so near to the shore. 
The key scens describes both a tiger shark and a great white.
I wonder if the mayor is paid off somewhere in the town or gets a cut of the beaches being open? He's far to adamant about keeping them open.   And I always thought Tiger Sharks were smaller. 
I always think of Great White's as the huge "Jaws" sharks. 
It seems odd that they don't ask a scientist or marine biologist at some point to intervene.
Even the last key scene describes a pretty limited plan to hook the shark or harpoon it.
I agree. They have an "Oceanographer" to help determine a shark attack. But no scientists ever get brought in to help the situation. 
It seems like a pretty poor plan, and they end up having to make it up as they go along. 
It seems crazy that a shark could take out a "Shark-proof" cage. 
Plus, the reward of only $10,000 seems pretty low to risk lives.
Maybe it was worth a lot more in 1975?
I agree. Not worth it to me. I'll go on vacation in NYC instead and avoid the shark. Haha. 
And it was definitely worth more in 1975. I just don't know how much. 
Hello! do you like comedy, adventure, and animation movies?
Yes I like all of those genres. What do you think about the rating of this movie?
i think the ratings are good. Rotten tomatoes gave it an 89% and cinemascore gave it an A+
Yes same here. It was very popular kids all wanted frozen themed everything. the story line was different from other Princess movies
yes, i thought it was a great disney movie with very cute characters
What do you think about the cast? Kristen bell is one of my faves.
i think the cast is great with idina menzel who has a beautiful voice
She was great, very distinctive voice. I think olof was the funniest.
i was very impressed with the animation and how pretty the whole movie was
The art was very nice, especially the ice castle scene.
it was in 3d. do you watch movies in 3d or 2d usually?
When i can catch the movies in 3d i try to watch them. It's a different experience but can easily ruin a movie. What do you think
i agree. it depends on the movie and the seats too
i thought it was sad when the parents died at sea
I like the rock family they were cute.
Do you think it will end up on B roadway?
i think it will. the songs were so catchy
I like that the hero in the movie is Elsas younger sister and not the typical prince.
me too. I like that it was about family and sisters too. 
Same here and being that I have two i could relate to how they felt about each other. 
i argree. i did not like Hans
who was your favorite character?
He was horribe, i did not like how he tried to make Ana the villain. But i did appreciate Kristoff and how helpful he was. 
My favorite character was olof. How about you?
i liked anna. she was precious
did you like the ending
What were your thoughts about the scene when Hans locked up elsa  in that room.
it was scary. i was surprised since she liked hans so much at the start
Yes i loved the ending, i liked that the town saw that Elsa was not as bad as Hans made her to be, and that Kristoff and ana ended up together
me too. 
He was a character the deception was great

hello there!
Hey!
how are you doing?
I believe I am supposed to convey to you why you should read The Social Network
I'm well, thanks!
Social Network the movie?
Correct!
What were you tasked with?
To discuss a movie with you
try to gather info and decide if I want to watch it at the end
Which movie?
Well I watched The Social Movie about 5 years ago for the first time and highly enjoyed it. 
which ever movie you were tasked with to talk to me about - in this case the Social Network
In particular Eisenberg's portrayal of Zuckerberg was highly compelling
and it's funny as well
Eisenberg is the lead actor?
And if you did not attend an Ivy League university, it gives you a sneak peak of what life inside one may be like
yes he is the lead actor
do you know which other movies he was in?
I'm not sure actually
This is the only one of his that I know at all
I hope he's not being typecast as Zuckerberg
Because he is a majorly talented actor
what other actors were there?
Justin Timberlake and Armie Hammer were also in it!
Timberlake was cool
He played the founder of Napster
and which was your favorite character?
Probably Eisenberg as Zuckerberg
wasn
wasn't the most likable character (that was probably Saverin) but he played the role incredbily well
a nuanced portrait
so the film is entirely biographical?
Yes
although I know that Zuckerberg has complained about the accuracy of the plot
there's quite a bit of tension in it
does it feature the "evil twins"? (I forgot their names)
Yes!
The Winklevoss twins!
although they don't sound/appear that evil in the film
they look cheated actually 
what's your favorite scene?
Probably the deposition of Zuckerberg
when he's being investigated for fraudulently  claiming he came up with the idea for Facebook
how about the soundtrack? anything worth noting?
so are you familiar with this movie? 
Yes
okay and what were youre thoughts on it?
It's very funny and shows how clique-ish high school can be.  Are you familiar with it as well?
i am to the best of my memory it was quite funny 
okay why  did you leave??
hoii
Hi. I loved the film, even though it's older, from 1975. Did you like it?
I think Patty Jenkins' take on the comic was amazing.
Hello, how are 
you doing?
Hi!  I'm doing well, thanks!
So, what did you think of the blind side?
I love sports documentaries, so I favored this movie. H ow about you?
It was quite good.  I'm not surprised it got such good reviews on Cinemascore
Same here. It is a little odd that it got lower reviews on other platforms like Metacritic. I take it you like sports docs too?
Yes, very much.  It's surprising how much adversity Oher had to overcome, don't you think?
Yeah, It must've been really difficult on him. I wonder how he felt having to relive his experience through the movie. I don't know how I would handle it. 
Did you like Sandra Bullock in the movie?
Yeah, Bullock was great.  Although, she's a great actor so I think she does well in most of her roles
Totally agree. Easy to see why the critics applauded her performance
Any thoughts on any of the other actors? I had forgotten Tim McGraw was in the movie, haha
I thought Quinton Aaron was very good, too.  
It must have been tough to go through foster care so much, but I think it's good that Oher found something to latch on to in football.
Yeah, he certainly excelled in it. I think he was able to apply his protective qualities in his personality to football
Definitely.  He was also very lucky to finally find a good foster family.  It's super difficult to find a good family that cares about their foster kids.
Yeah, I would imagine that it's hard. I feel like that's why it was such agood movie. Nothing seemed to be all that good in his life until he found a family that would treat him like one of their own
What do you think of the idea of "protective instincts" and how it influenced Oher's behavior?
I remember he ranked very high when he was taking his career test. It definitely translated well into his efforts in football. Do you think that helped his family as well?
I'm sure it did.  It's ironic, though, that he has such strong protective instincts when he was abandoned by his mother. Do you think he was overcompensating?
How did you feel about the scene where Collins adopts Oher?
As for being overcompensating, that he was not. I think that was built naturally in him, where he was not consciously  trying to do it.
How did you feel about the scene where Collins adopts Oher?
I think LeighAnne's friends were concerned that Collins would not be safe around him.
I think that was probably a tough choice for the family to make as a whole.
Do you think going to Ole Miss was a good decision?
Yeah in the long run, he felt like he had family there. Do you think that he meant his mother at all in that choice?
Probably not because she was a drug addict.  I think he was referring to his adopted family.
How do you think the gang leader in his old town affected him?
I think that was what grew his protective instincts even more. He was worried what might happen to his adoptive family when Leigh Anne and Collins were threatened by the gang leader. 
Do you think he made the right decision to fight back?
Yeah, definitely, you have to protect yourself!
Absolutely, I think he felt more of a connection with his adoptive family than with his own!
Definitely, and who wouldn't.  I don't understand why people are so connected to their blood relatives if they weren't around to be part of their family
Yep. It seems like the Tuohy family accepted him and made him feel like he belonged there with him.
Good conversation, thanks for chatting!
Hello
Do you have a movie document?
No I donât
The movie we got is The Notebook.  Do you know it?
What do we chat about?
Iâve seen it but a while back.
Since you didn't get the document, I have to give you info to respond to.
Okay cool. So whats this movie about?
This was a love story between a man a woman who is now in a nursing home.
We see them both in their older days and younger days.
How romantic. I like movies like that. Who acts in it?
This movie made stars out of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams.
Ryan Gosling is the best, so this is the movie that made him big. Is it a period piece?
you could say that, because it starts in 1940
in the U.S. south
one thing that might surprise fans is that it didn't get great reviews from critics.  they thought it was too sappy
Yeah I donât really listen to critics as most times they get it wrong. Did you think it was too sappy?
i remember liking it, that it felt like a real love affair
they feed me more information the longer we chat.
Nice. Do you know who directed it?
the director is named Nick Cassavetes.  his mother actually plays the older version of the female lead
Wow that is amazing but maybe would be tough to direct your own Mother. Do you know what rating the movie got like on Rotten Tomato?
52%
That sucks. What was your best scene?
the next scene they mention is how the girl's mother hides the boy's letters from her, because she doesn't want her daughter to be with him
What wouldnât they want them to be together? Is he a bad boy?
she's from a rich family.  he's not.
final scene to discuss:  the mother admits what she's done and gives her daughter the letters
Okay get it now. I guess that ended up well. 
by then, her daughter had gotten engaged to someone else
Oh no, so how did they get back together?
her mom shows her what became of lower-class boy she loved once (he's still lower class).  she didn't want her daughter to struggle with money
the daughter just has to decide what's important to her
in the end, she chooses the lower class guy
I guess she made the right choice then, to chose her happiness and get with him?
Sounds like a fantastic movie.
Do you know when it was released?
2004
That was a while back.
yeah
Was there any critical reviews or responses about it?
they praise the performances, but criticize the "sappy" writing
are you a love story fan?
Do you consider it to be one of the classics? 
I like Love stories
not exactly a classic, maybe.  but pretty good.  
i'm surprised the task hasn't ended yet
I know.
It makes me want to watch the movie again.
Was there anything about it that you didnât like?
oh, i suppose the letter thing was a little annoying.  lots of movies have already done that
Yeah your right there.
i think it's safe for us to click "finish conversation".  we've already gone past the number of exchanges needed
Well nice talking to you.
hi
how are you
what is todays topic?
hello 
what topic
the movie titled " The Notebook"
It was a romatic movie
It was directed by Nick Cassabetes.
Do you know this Movie have you watcehd it?
i dont see
what year it was release?
It was given a 52% rating by the Rotten Tomatoes
who are the main character
 Main Actor was Ryan Gosling as Noah Calhoun
what you like in the movie?
Rachel McAdams as Allison "Allie" Hamilton
It was a narated movie 
Animated???
 It is a love story of two young lovers and the  story was from the past  1946,
i think it was like titanic?
The movie was based a Novel by Nicholas Spark  "Notebook" release in 1996
what was the tuning point of the movie?
like the main part ?
NO but maybe just the same because it was a Romantic Drama movie..
action?
comedy?
Noah writes to Allie every day for a year but Anne intercepts the letters and they never reach Allie. Noah enlists with Fin to fight in World War II, where Fin is killed in battle. Allie volunteers in a hospital for wounded soldiers, where she meets officer Lon Hammond Jr., a young lawyer who comes from old Southern money. The two become engaged, to the delight of Allie's parents. When Noah returns from the war, his father has sold their home so that Noah can buy the abandoned house. While visiting Charleston, Noah witnesses Allie and Lon kissing at a restaurant; he convinces himself that if he restores the house, Allie will come back to him. Allie is startled to read in the newspaper that Noah has completed the house to the specifications she made years before.
that was in the story
A Romantic drama
oh
do you watched or do you like Romantic Drama movies?
very nice
yeah I think I would like to watched this movie to check..
How about you?
yes
shure i would
thanks for information
yeah me too.. 
welcome.. its nice to talk to you
i think nice talk between us
bye
Thank  you
hi
HI
Zootopia have u see this movie
hello
Hello!
What do you like the most about this movie?
I really enjoyed the music from this film!  What was your favorite thing about Frozen?
The songs
My kids love it
I also like that it was inspired by an existing fairy tale.
The animation was excellent and amazing!
Yeah, the animation and the plot is amazing
What is your favorite chARACTER?
*CHARACTER
Mine is Anna
Anna.  I'm a fan of Kristen Bell's other work as well.
I love her voice!
I like that Anna was fearless, and didn't act like your typical Disney princess.
That's right...she's extroverted and fun!
The first part of the movie, explaining how the sisters were orphaned, and how their circumstances drove them apart was tragic, but I do like how everything wrapped up in the end.
It's hard to believe this is Disney's 53rd animated feature film!  I'd find it difficult to even name that many Disney animated features!
Yeah, the ending  has a very special meaning
Do you have any other favorite film?
from Disney
A few, but I thought for purposes of this exercise, we must confine our conversation to the information in the document?
That's correct
What is your rating for Frozen?
The document is growing, and additional detailed information about scenes from the movie were just added.  I'm reminded of the scene where Elsa builds her ice palace.  It was an impressive bit of computer generated animation.
I would rate Frozen as an 80%, or 8 out of 10. 
Yeah, the animation was outstanding
My favorite scene is when Anna gets hitby Elsa  at the very beginning.
The Duke of Weselton has a name that looks suspiciously like the term weasel !
I like all the scenes with musical numbers in them.
What did you like the least about the film?
I did not like that the parents died
did you know that there is a scene where rapunzel appears in Frozen?
The parents dying was sad and unexpected, and a dramatic way to start the film
I did not know that Rapunzel appeared in Frozen. 
Yeah, very briefly
I have to agree it's the best Disney animated film in quite a few years... since the Lion King.
Yeah, the best film in modern animation.
hey
hey
Great movie huh?
It's alright.  Got some funny moments but its fairly forgettable
Really you think its forgettable?
Yeah.  I mean it's got a decent cast, but i've actually watched it a couple of times and I don't remember a whole lot about it
I think this is another one of Leo's movies that put him on the map
I dont know maybe im just bias cause I love all his movies
I don't really follow the actors very much.  I'm far more interested in the characters they portray.
eh, fair enough
Well you have Leonardo Dicaprio he plays the protagonist who is a fraud and takes up all kinds of random jobs. He has no experience at all but is just a great con. Then you have Tom Hanks who plays as a FBI agent and he is tracking down Leo.
yeah  dicaprio does a decent job with a less than memorable script, but ive never been really interested in biographical movies
So you did not like The Wolf of Wall Street?
never saw that one, so i can't say
That was Biographic
Wasn't directed by spielberg tho it was directed by Martin Scorsese  
like i said, im not really interested in them.  if i wanted to learn about a person's life, i'd do actual research since movies tend to exagerate
Yea true but its all entertainment and from watching the film you learn of these people they are portraying and it strikes interest for you to do your own research after.
well wall street isn't anywhere near my area of interest so even if i watched it i doubt i'd do anything further
eh
its personal preferenece
Sounds like your more into Documentary?  
it depends on the topic.  animals yes, history yes, Modern Marvels not so much
I like all kinds of things from all different movie genres, Memories, Docs and even Cartoons like Family Guy and even Anime.
ditto, but it has to really pique my interest.  although i find family guy and other similar TV shows offensive, so i avoid them like the plague
You know there meant to be funny but in a good way there all satire. It is the same thing if you watch Stand up comedians.  
i understand that its satire, but i still think they take it too far.  so i don't watch it.  i don't blast people who do, but i just try to avoid them
Stand up comics like Dave Chappelle and shows like Family Guy and South park are a good thing. Yea they make fun of serious topics but it is needed in today's society of cry babies. It brings people from all Cultures Race and and backgrounds together for a good laugh.
to each their own
How does the Requester for this hit expect us to talk about one movie this long?
no idea
hello
how are you
im talkin whit you about this movie
Iron Man
hi, fine :)
Do you like films about superheroes? :)
yes i do
I really like classic movies
Iron Man is based on the Marvel Comics, did you read it?
I am not sure if Iron Man belongs to the group of 'classic movies' :)
Have you watch any other film directed by Jon Favreau?
This is a marvel superhero movie, if it is. I think I've seen it before.
this was his first delivery
info from the critics 'a slighty depressed'... what do you think about it?
apparently it was a very low criticism but it responded to the expectations of the followers
Being directed by Jon Favreau, he was very successful with the group of Stan Lee, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway.
Movies belong to the genre SuperHero can be produced only in Hollywood probably...
the majority was from that city
The plot is based around Tony Stark, an entrepreneur and engineer, who builds a motorized exoskeleton and becomes a technologically advanced superhero.
Tony Stark "Genius, billionaire who has inherited the defense contractor from his father'... It couldn't happen in other part of the world :)
On the other hand, the question is, why such movies are produced only in the USA...
I have to watch this film one again...
It's 2008
I think that it is the most technologically advanced country in the world of superheroes
what do you think in general about this film?
It is a movie that had a lot of success and acceptance, it has great special effects and good argument.
 Do you like movies of SuperHeroes?
if I really like
 Do you generally watch movies with a lot of special effects?
almost all have it especially of wars or super heroes
 I liked this scene on the top of the Stark Industries building
probably because I have a little fear of heights
then you suffer a little vertigo
Do you generally watch movies with good ratings or do you prefer to give a chance to have your own view about movies?
and it's the reason why I usually do not fight on the top of the buildings :)
I prefer to have my own qualification, sometimes I do not like the recommended movies and other times I like unpopular movies but they end up being great.
you work in mturk
from time to time 
for a moment I thought that this a robot
it difficult to check :)
i understand
but moving to our topic...
In general this movie began in 1990 with Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, and New Line Cinema before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2005.
interesting why in such films bad people are killed at the end... :)
and Stane with his armor fell into the exploding reactor...
probably we can finish our conversation...
maybe
all full
Marvel put the project into production as its first self-financed film, with 20th Century Fox as its distributor.
thank you for conversation...
bye
than to you
Hi there!
I haven't seen Bruce Almighty for some reason, but I do love Jim Carrey.
I haven't seen this one either, but I have heard that it is pretty funny.
It's a pretty great idea. I'm sure it's not one of the greatest movies ever made, but he is really funny and so is Morgan Freeman.
Jennifer Aniston annoys me a little though, I gotta say
I really do like Morgan Freeman, most of his movies are good. I think I might have to check this one out.
I look at Rotten Tomatoes a lot for movie ratings though, and 48% is pretty low. It has been out for a while, though.
 I don't know why, but she has annoyed me through the years too. I can't quite put my finger on what it is, I just don't really like her very much.
 Yes, it has been out for quite some time. Maybe it's on Netflix.
Do you like comedies like this, or are you more into dramas?
 My favorite movie genre is science fiction, but I do like a good comedy, or a good drama. If it's a good movie, I really don't care what genre it is.
That's true. The first review under the "critical response" section is pretty harsh. I'm not sure I really ever read or care about movie reviews, just the ratings % online
 When looking at movie reviews, I put more faith in actual regular people that go see the movie then I do official critics.
True. Looking at the Key Scenes, I feel like the plot might have been a little paint-by-numbers and relying on Jim Carrey's personality too much, which is probably why it wasn't better recieved.
 Yes, I can I didn't get that impression.
 Sorry, this is supposed to say that I did get that impression.
I guess that's part of his appeal, he can take any kind of material and make it funny. Also Steve Carrell is a great, funny actor too and I can see him being a good villian.
 Yes, he is pretty good in everything he does.
I haven't even heard of Metacritic or CinemaScore, to be honest. But it's weird that it's 46/100 on Metacritic and and A on CinemaScore. Those are pretty different scores.
 That's true, I'm not sure how they score these things.
The part where he creates the email system to answer prayers and sets it to auto-reply "yes" is pretty funny and says a lot about religion.
 Sounds pretty funny, I will have to put it on my list.
I do think maybe some of the scenes they describe with Jimmy Hoffa's body sound cheesy. I'm not sure!
 I agree with that statement.
I do think if I had the power of being God I'd use it for better things!
 For sure!
Interesting. I mean, the way the rest of the plot wraps up seems pretty standard.
 I agree, however, it might be worth a watch.
The best part of the movie is probably the middle section where he's testing out all of his powers. Seems like the end might be disappointing based on this description.
 I'm not the hugest Jim Carrey fan, but I'll give it a try.
Yeah I think he is so out-there that this is a perfect film for him.
 Yeah, he always seems to play some crazy out-of-control guy.
Hi. 'The Imitation Game' is based on a true story about code breaking in WWII. Great reviews.
don
it is about for good person
It is about good people. It's a thriller, but actually happened.
The movie is called The Imitation Game, a drama that received a score of 91% on Rotten Tomatoes.
Nice, what is the movie about?
Have you heard of this movie?  It is about a cryptanalyst named Alan Turing who decrypted German intelligence codes for the British government during WW2.
I have not heard about it. If sounds like it would be a good movie. I already like the plot of the movie. Who plays in it? 
This movie stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing, Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander and Tom Goodman-Hill as Sgt. Staehl - in all honesty I don't think I have heard of any of them haha.
I have heard of Keira Knightley, I liked the Disney Pirate moves with Jack Sparrow. She played in all the movies. Good actress. I am surprised you have not heard of her. 
I have seen the movies, other than Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom I probably couldn't name the rest of the cast.
The Imitation Game received great reviews from critics and a CinemaScore of A+
I do not think I can either, I would need to google them just to see who they are and what they have been in the past. I hope they put together a good cast and crew for this movie. 
that is nice, that gives me hope that it will be good. 
The Imitation Game is directed by Morten Tyldum, are you familiar with any of his other movies?
I dont think so, what else has he produced? 
I honestly have no idea...  
I'm sorry, this is taking too long to progress to the next one I'm going to return this HIT.
Another item we would have to google to look up. 
Good morning
Good morning!
Have you ever seen the movie 'the blind side'?
Have you seen the Blind Side before?
Ha! Yes but it's been awhile.
Jinx. :)
You?
Same for me, it has been a while since I last seen it
I'm surprised it got such low reviews.
I agree, the numbers seem far too low. IMDb's score is not listed, however
Do you like Sandra Bullock?
She is quite good in all of her films.
What do you think of her?
I agree. I thought she was really good in this one too.
The guy that played Big Mike was good too
Agreed, they both were quite good
The back story for Mike was kind of sad
Indeed. It is an interesting story. Seeing this boy go from poverty and sleeping on someone's couch to college prospect, and then professional player was inspiring
I'm sure the movie inspired a lot of other young athletes
Understandably
I think it's incredible that this family took him in like that
It is incredible. Something that is totally lacking in most of the world, to be honest
which is why they had to make a movie about it :)
Of course
I would be curious to know where Mike is today
He is still in the NFL, I believe
I am not as sure as to what team he plays for, but I am relatively sure that he is still playing
I didn't remember that Tim McGraw was the dad. He's the big country singer right?
He is. I do not remember him much from the movie, which may or may not be a bad thing
Alright have a good day!
helllo lets talk about the great gatsby 2013 edition
Hello. Can you tell me the plot?
Its based upon the 1925 novel by f. scott fitzgerald 
Who plays Gatsby?
Leonardo Dicaprio Playes gatsby
I like him. Who plays Daisy?
it was carey mulligan 
What would you rate the movie?
I would say its a less conventional theatrical celebration of the emotional and material extravagance that fitzgerald surveyed with fascinated abivalence
Should I watch it?
I don't know but did you know tobey maguire who played nick carraway was also the narrator of the movie?
I did not know that. 
do you like other movies with leonardo dicaprio in it mabee if you do you will like this one
Yes, I love Leonardo Dicaprio. He's a great actor
it gets a cinema score of b  and gives a good picture of the roaring  twenties in new york state
Is it similar to the book?
You know i dont know how similar to the book it is i never read it but perhaps you could find that info online
I read the book in high school. I'll check online.
if you do watch the movie i found the stand out actor is joel edgerton as he was very good and showing the grufness of the character he played joel edgerton
I like Joel Edgerton.
and he really does a great job despite the one dimensionality given to his role
He's a great actor.
i didn't like the sean when gatsby got shot before he could answer the phone it was sad
I remember that scene from the book. Daisy didn't seem to really love him.
and he thought it was daisy calling him but never got the chance to find out because george shot him then commited suicide and the media planted gatsby as myrtles lover and killer
That is sad.
mabee the sadness of the whole movie is what caused the metaccritic score to only be 55/100
That's true. I'll look through them before I watch it. 
the scene where nick finishes typing his memoir and titles it the great gatsby after his final walkthrew of gatsby's mansion i really liked and disliked as it brings a sense of the emptiness  we all leave behind when we pass on
That is very sad. Well I think I'll watch it tomorrow.
Hello. what is the movie?
Hey, t he movie we got is The Imitation Game
What is it about?
It is a biography of about Alan Turing, a British cryptanalyst who decrypted German intelligence codes during World War 2.
Who is the lead actors?
The lead actors are Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley
Do they successfully decrypt the code?
I am not sure if they successfully decrypt the code, I would assume so otherwise I doubt it would be as historically relevant.
Okay. What kind of movie is it? Thriller? Drama? Comedy?
It is a drama
Any other known actors in it?
Yeah, there is Matthew Goode and Tom Goodman-Hill in the movie as well.
How long is the movie?
I am not sure how long the movie is, if I had to guess I'd say 2 hours.
What year was it released originally ?
It was originally released in 2014.
Did it win any awards?
It doesn't mention winning any awards, however it has amazing reviews from different organizations.
Can you tell me more about the reviews?
The film received a CinemaScore of A+ as well as a Rotten Tomatoes review of 91%.
There are quite a few key scenes throughout the movie that are relevant  as well.
Relevant to what?
To the story. One of them explains how the main character, Alan Turing is unhappy in his boarding school due to bullying. It is through that unhappiness that he found his interest in cryptography.
I 'm quite interested in the movie. Anything else you want to tell me?
I don't want to give too much away, but there is a few points where characters are revealed as spys and release important information about the main character.
Ph, spy. i love spy.
I do too. Also, there are a lot of secrets within the movie about the main character as well that are incredibly important to the story.
But I can't say
How did it do in the box office?
I don't have any specifics, but based off the reviews of the film I would say very well.
What else do you know about the movie?
I know that it has been regarded as one of the most important stories of the last century.
Who is the director?
There is some controversy however with the film, like some people are upset due to misrepresentation of facts and rearranging things to make a better story.
The director was Morten Tyldum.
Is it because the lead character is gay?
I don't know if it has to due with him being gay, more so the order at which events were revealed misrepresented the work that Turning did at Bletchley Park.
Thanks. It's nice chatting with you.
You too!
hi
do you like frozen?
I love Frozen!
I love frozen yogurt! but also this movie :)
LOL!  I Cant wait for the second movie of Frozen to release
what is your favorite character?
Anna because shes independent!
yours?
I like Elsa
she reminds of my friend of the same name
also the character designs are cool
thats cool! Anna reminds me of my girls - they are red-heads too
do you like the songs?
Of course - who doesnt!  We still sing them around our house! 
that is awesome!
The first time we saw Frozen was on a Disney Cruise Ship 
what's your favorite?
I love Let it Go but also In Summer - especially now since its so cold!  Whats your favorite
i don't remember
do you have a favorite part of the movie
the snowman is a funny character
he is hilarious. 
olaf?
yes
do you have a favorite scene?
I really like the scene with the Trolls.  The ending also gets me every time when Elsa saves Anna. 
whats yours
the ending is great
the scene with the trolls too.
I hope the trolls are in the second movie more
haha maybe they will have their own spinoff movie
that would be cute too
nice chatting to you. Have a good day!
you too
hello
Hi
Hello. Do you like movies?
Yes, but ones based on old toys are werid
This one is called Real Steel and I trying to remember if I've watched it.
I haven't, no interest in it
I agree with the reviewer stating it's Rocky with robots
I also think it's a little bit inspired by rock em sock em robots, an old toy
Okay. I do remember watching it, because I saw that Hugh Jackman was in it. 
Sometimes I'll watch these if they keep my interest. I think I only watched it because of him.
He is a good actor Nice to see him as someone other than Logan once in a while, lol
Yea, I like thrillers or drama, who-dun-it kind of movies.
This is more of an action film with robots
Rotten tomatoes gives it 59 percent. I guess that means they say it's an ok kind of move. I remember the boxing robots though.
The deal where the winner gets the loser's robot seems a bit extreme
Lol. I see the movie was filmed totally in Michigan. Good for them. Tax credits. 
Yeah, that was nice while it lasted. Seems to have dried up though
I live in Ohio and I hear about those "credits" for movies being made here. Normally I'd watch Hugh Jackman in other movies.
He's a decent actor. 
Didn't realize this movie was that old - 2011, time goes quick. I don't recognize the other actors.
Neither do i
This reads like a standard boxing movie... but with robots
Do you like boxing as a sport?
Nah
I don't like most sports though
I'm reading through here looking for interesting facts about the movie. It says the film's based on a short story called "Steel" which was orginally published in 1956, later adapted into a Twilight Zone episode in 1963. Now that's interesting. The old Twilight Zone shows frightened me. lol
I love old Twilight Zone but don't recall the one this is based on
True. Weird, but even today some of the episodes spooked me.  It says the Metacritic Score 56/100. Who's Metacritic? 
I think they're another review aggregate site?
I watch the Twilight Zone mrathons on Syfy all the time
If I watch them, it's only in daytime. I'm such a wimp. lol. I'm not familiar with director either - Shawn Levy
Doesn't ring any bells for me either
Genre is Science, Sports, yep that's true.
Hello, Goodafternoon
Hi there like wise
The title of the film is The Great Getsby
Today we are gonna talk about The Great Gatsby/
Have you seen it?
It was published in 2013.
Surprisingly I think I heard of it but never seen it. You?
yea already been 5 years.
I read the book and watched it.
Do you know who plays Gatsby?
Leonardo DiCaprio
Did you like it?
It had its moments for me.
This is a romance drama film
Some parts where to fantasy for me.
Really?
I do like how grand the parties were that Gatsby would throw.
Yes there was a lot slowing down and obvious green screen to me.
It did get a 48% on rotten tomatoes.
Well in scene 1 Nick Carraway who is a WW1 veteran begins talking about Jay Gatsby.
How hopeful he had been.
Yea I remember that.
Overall I think the movie was good, I just couldn't stand Daisy.
Nick moves to New York and sees Gatsby.
Daisy was Gatsby love interest.
Really?
Yes a very wealthy girl, who Gatsby trys to impress
Gatsby tells Tom of his affair with Daisy.
Tom is her husband.
Yes, he does. Tom didn't seem to bothered though.
He was allowed to have his affairs.
Gatsby was killed in scene 3.
You should watch it if you have time :)
Yes, a gun shot.
hello
Hello. Have you watched The Social Network? It was a surprisingly good movie.
I have not
It sounds like a good film
Yes, I'm here
The performances were great. Justin Timberlake is not only a talented singer but a pretty good actor as well. Jesse Eisenberg fit the part very well too.
Hello?
Hello
I'm here
I was just going to ask how Timberlake was as an actor
Hi. I was saying how Justin Timberlake and Jesse Eisenberg were pretty good actors.
Yeah. He's better than I thought he would be.
I'm not usually into Biographies 
Me neither but this one was pretty good. 
But this one is probably a decent one to watch
It's crazy how fast Fb blew up
It would be interesting to watch the film
It is. I didn't think Mark Zuckerberg had a very interesting life but I guess he has.
Facebook is a monster.
I don't think most people could live without it at this point in time.
I bet. He was pretty young when he made fb wasn't he
It's kind of messed up though. Zuckerberg was accused of stealing someone else's ideas to get started.
Yeah. He was still in college.
Yeah, too many people relay on fb now! 
I know. It's fun but people use it a little too much.
The movie doesn't really go into that though. They need to do a sequel that talks about how FB has affected society.
yeah, that would be cool to see
more of a documentary  of sorts. 
It started out as a simple chat to help college students with dating but turned into something much bigger.
Kind of a dramatized documentary though.
lol, right!
Hi there!
Hi!
So you have any movie in mind? :)
So Mean Girls is the film
84% rotten tomatoes 6.9/10
Mean girls? I have watch that before and it was back when Lindsay Lohan was good.
Yes like 14 years ago!
What makes you think I should rewatch it again my friend?
Yes, its crazy!
A reminder of Lindsay being good lol
She was very hot at the time.
I like that she transitioned from being home schooled to public school
haha!
Yeah, I forgot about that part.
Kind of reminds me of me
I only remember their dance, the Christmas dance, that was hot.
I moved and started high school like her
Yeah, I agree
Ohh so was it tough?
Just like in the movie?
LOL
Just starting at a new high school, being an outsider
I liked her group of friends even though they were mena
mean
Ohh okay, I can relate being an outsider.
The Plastics
For sure I mean if they werent mean, the movie wouldnt happen...
Oh and her crush!
What's that? A movie?
Shane
The mean girls were called the plastics
Ohh I forgot about him, all I can remember are the girls, lol.
Lol
I'd watch it just for that scene
The christmas dance? :D
Yes!
wouldn't you?
Lol, I think we could be best friends just you saying that.
lol!
I would, always lol, that was cute and hot at the same time.
Typical high school stuff though
Yeah, its not really about making a compelling story but I guess the movie just wants you to have fun.
Hey, how are you?
Do you like Monsters University?
I do, I thought Billy did a good job as Mike
Yeah Billy Crystal is great. Who is your favorite character?
Mike was. Monster U is cute and funny and the animation, though not exactly inspired, has a lot of color.
I really liked all the comedy in it. And the music
The comedy is true to the spirit of Monsters Inc and matches its tone but never seemed content to turn over old ground. The music hit all the right notes I think
I agree, it was a very safe bet for Pixar with how they presented it.
Superstar actors doing voice acting is always going to make money, though.
I agree, it has enough stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz of cuteness has melted away. For a mere prequel, that's a good result.
I liked the whole fraternity aspect of it, very tongue in cheek.
Yes, it was a refreshing outlook on the series as a whole and provided a nice background for the characters.
I thought the scene of Mike at 7 years old was a good call-back too.
I agree, I liked when they show Mike's background story of why he became a scarer. I always wondered why he chose to do that
I also like how they show the friendship between Mike and Sully develop
Yeah I never thought of Sully as the cool guy iike that
I didn't know Sully had such a pretentious  background compared to other characters. It explains why only he was accepted into Roar Omega Roar.
True, and it does do a good job of showing how both characters are flawed.
I thought the whole Scare Games plot was a fairly good one too, kept it interesting.
I agree, I like that they didn't try to make them perfect. 
Yes! And so much was at stake for them in that game as well
It would decide if they could be renerolled or not. How do you feel about how Sully cheated?
I thought it was delaying the inevitable and giving them a false sense of accomplishment.
I agree, I felt bad for Mike who thought he succeeded on his own terms but instead was helped to win
I thought it was ironic too since they only get eliminated from the first challenge because another team was diqualified for cheating.
Yes I agree. It ended up causing them to become expelled from the university as well
I feel like they sacrificed themselves for the rest of the fraternity to get accepted though.
I agree and I think that it was a noble thing to do. At least they still were able to be hired at Monsters, Inc. and work their way up to becoming scarers.
Yeah, guess it shows that you don't need education sometime! Haha.
Exactly, sometimes all that's needed is preservation  and hardwork!
At least they didn't get in a lot of trouble with the CDA
Yeah I was taken aback when Hardscrabble said they were the first students to surprise her.
I agree, I thought they weren't too special. All in all it was a great movie!
I didn't know Billy Crystal was the voice of Mike but I love it!
Steve  Buscemi is in this too?
Yes he is! I'm guessing you've seen Monsters University?
I did when it came out years ago, just never thought to look at the voice acting.
When did you see it?
Hello! Isn't Monsters University a great movie? It was true to the spirit of Monsters, Inc. and matched its tone. 
I agree.  It was a good movie
What was your favorite part?
I liked when Mike and Sully didn't finish the program and worked their way up the ranks anyways.
Me too! It was very inspiring and showed that you can accomplish your dreams many ways. I liked how the movie expanded on the monster world. 
Yes.  The first movie only gave one facet of the world, while the second developed the setting to a much larger degree.
When I heard they were making another Monsters Inc movie I expected a sequel, not a prequel. But I ended up loving it! Did you see it in theatres?
I don't think we saw it in the theatre.  I think we rented it.  It's been a while though.  I should show it to my kids.  They would probably like it.
I bet they would! I don't have kids but my coworkers do. I love Disney/Pixar movies so I recommend them to my coworkers a lot. 
I really enjoy Randy Newman's music on this, the Toy Story movies, and Finding Nemo/Dory.
Me too! I think the Toy Story movies might be my favorite Pixar movies. Did you hear that they're building a Toy Story Land in Walt Disney World this summer? 
I did hear that.  It sounds pretty interesting.  
I'm going to WDW in the fall so I'm excited to see how the park is. Have you ever been? Or to Disneyland?
I've been to WDW a few times.  Never to Disneyland though.  California is pretty far away from me.  We went camping at WDW last year though.  It was great.
That's what I'm doing in the fall! I'm really looking forward to camping there!
It was really great.  We camped for four nights I think.  It rained like crazy the first day, but it was still fun.
Do you like Mike or Sulley better?
Oh good question! I think I like Mike more. He's weirdly optimistic. 
How about you?
I like Mike because he's funnier.  He had some of the best lines in the first movie.
He is SO funny!! 
I always liked John Goodman's voice acting for Sully, though. It's perfect for a big, fluffy monster
The part at the end of the first movie when he burps out the microphone makes my kids laugh so hard.
I agree. John Goodman was a great choice for Sulley.
Hahah I bet!!! 
I love the scare machine they had in the prequel that the students had to frighten for the contest. That was pretty neat
Yeah, though I was really disappointed with Sulley for cheating.
I was too, that broke my heart. I cried when that happened!
It was really a cruel thing for him to do to MIke
It seemed a little out of character for Sulley, but I guess they had to have some final source of conflict between the two to keep the plot moving.
I agree, it was probably my least favorite part of the movie. I feel like they could have taken the story in a different direction.
For Sully to trick Mike into thinking he was scary was just so hurtful! 
I do like that they ended up working so hard to achieve their dreams though.  That's a good message that Disney started doing with the Princess and the Frog.
Me too! I like that common thread between the two movies. I think it was executed better in this though, because they really did start from the very bottom of Monsters, Inch
And it explains why they're always nice to the other nerdy janitors in the original movie.  They were once in that same position.
Oh my gosh!!! I didn't even realize that! I have to rewatch the movie. You're totally right!
It does show a really good message for kids, to be respectful of everybody
It's a valuable message.  Be kind and respectful to everyone.  Don't expect to lean on your credentials or family reputation to get you somewhere in life.  Just be prepared to work your hardest.
Yes! I liked that they showed Sully as this spoiled brat at first who eventually learned that you can't always lean on your family's reputation. It can only get you so far
Maybe his spoiled background is why he cheated in the competition, because he didn't really realize the consequences of his actions, just did what he thought was right
I feel like a lot of kids need that message these days.
You've got a good point there about the cheating.
And you have a good point there about kids needing that message!
I like that they had to work hard together too, so it didn't feel like so much of a struggle. Because Mike and Sully had each other to share in that struggle of working their way up the corporate ladder
hi
Hi are there any good movies out?
yes have you ever seen a batman movie
Yes, I love Batman movies! Who is the actor?
it was christian bale
Oh wow, I love him. Is there a lot of action in the movie?
yes it was a darker take on batman it explored batman's damaged mind
Wow. Does the joker play an important role in it?
no i think it was scare crow
Oh okay. Is it a long movie?
i would say about a hour and a half
That's not too bad. 
would you like to hear a bit about the plot
I really want to watch this movie I think
Sure!
ok it starts with bruce as a child
Ah okay. Are his parents alive?
Also, what is the name of this movie?
they get kill at the movies after bruce wants to leave 
batman begins
Okay. Does Bruce want to  seek revenge for the death of his parents?
yes but someone kills the guy first
Okay. Does Bruce inherit a lot of money from his parents?
yes and he goes and travels the world
to learn how to fight injustice 
Oh okay. Who teaches him how to fight?

So is Bruce loved by the people of Gotham?
I think  so
i will let you see the rest for yourself
thanks for the chat
Thanks
All the best
Hi, do you think this movie deserved a 92% Rotten Tomatoes score? That seems awfully high.
It's hard to say, They are usually my go to website for reviews but its rare you see a score in the 90% area.
I have noticed that too! I love Octavia Spencer in anything she does. 
I don't know much of her work but I am a big fan of Guillermo Del Toro
and it seems the critics had alot to say on this film as well !
I'll have to check out his other films. I am impressed that a movie about a humanoid amphibian creature could be described as "elegant and mesmerizing".
that is quite the compliment indeed,  I have yet to see the it but i definitely plan too. are you a fan of drama films?
I really love drama films, but I try to stay away from fantasy. I liked this one, though.
The acting by Michael Shannon and Octavia Spencer was impressive.
Jaws is a very good movie even though it is older!
Jaws was made in 1975 and stars Roy Scheider.
how was the horror element?
It is scary but works because of the characters of the movie.
that's cool
I did not know it was from a novel wrote in 1974.  Did you?
no I did not know that
It was written by Peter Benchley.
how's the acting
I suppose the acting is good due to the direction of Steven Spielberg.
does the shark do a lot of damage
It starts with the shark pulling a woman that is skinny dipping down in the ocean.
Her name is chrissie Watkins and her remains are found on shore the next day.
that sound scary
what do they do about the shark
I know.  Of course then the police chief wants to close the beach for safety but the mayor says no due to the tourist season and summer economy.
What I can't believe is that because of the mayor the coroner changes his ruling from shark attack to boat attack.
wow what ashame
The place a bounty on the shark after he attacks another person.
did someone take it
The local fisherman do catch a shark, a tiger shark. They assume that that's the killer shark.
but i assume that the shark comes again
Oh yeah, on the fourth of July it comes up and kills the police chief's son.
Did you know that jaws is actually supposed to be a great white shark?
that is intresting
were they able to stop the shark
I think one of the best scenes is when the police chief, the shark expert, and the shark hunter all get together to on the shark hunter's boat, the Orca.  
that sounds cool
They finally do at the end.  They harpoon it while on the Orca but it get's away.
It attacks the boat and eats the shark hunter.
wow that must be scary
Then the police chief stuffs a pressurized scuba tank into it's mouth and shoots the tank.
thanks i will watch this movie
You really should.
bye
bye
hey partner
hey partner
hey
I like the movie, about about you?
No document
The move is home alone
Hi
Hi
Would you like a movie recommendation?
Sure, which film is it?
Have you seen The Great Gatsby the one from 2013?
Ohh that movie, no I haven't yet
I'm actually not even too familiar with the original
it has lenardo dicaprio as jay  gatsby.
It is a period romantic drama based on the book by f scott fitzgerald.
older book from 1925 but a well known one.
Oh ok yes I've heard of it, so i figure it's CasaBlanca-ish?
No, not at all.
Well ..not really.
It is todl through thte yes of nick carraway, in this film toby maguire.
He meets jay gatsby while living next door and gets introduced to the party world of the roaring 20s in new york state.
I guess I'm not really too familiar with Fitzgerald stuff, Oh ok so during the Capone era, I'm interested in that era
I think you would like it then.
But the book is genreally heldinmuch higher regard.
This movie did not do to well with  the critics.
Only 48% from rotten tomatoes.. 
are you doing something else?
No i'm just terrible at typing
I dont think id want to watch this movie
3 minutes is toolong and to be honest a little rude.
It is more of a spectacle to behold.
5 minutes is too long
The director baz luhrmann is kind of know for that.
3 is 2 minutes less than too long
it is still rude
and makes me think you are doing another turk or something else
just saying
Anyways sounds like a trash movie
lol
well if you watch it than you can know for sure one way or another.
I actually did like it.
But I enjoy the actors in it and liked  the showy dance numbers.
Maybe since Decapro is a genius id watch it sometime
They had a budget of like 190 million and it shows, I think. 
He is a phenomenal actor.
Huge bugdet did it make it back lol?
Joel edgerton gto a lot of prai se form critic for his perfomance as well
I am not sure..
Is there any gun fights in it
Gatsby is a millionaire so has to be lavish sets etc
Ummm not really but there is a death or two.
Actually there is a shooting
Whos the actor that decaprio falls in love with
Carey mulligan/daisy
She is his pats lover and tom's wife- joel edgerton
also nick's cousin.
It is worth a watch but the book you may want to read first.
I always  prefer to read the book first.
What else does fitzgerald write?
The critics also advise to put aside any literary agenda to best enjoy the movie.
A bunch but can't get into  that on here.
Aww, I see, ok. maybe ill catch it sometime on the flix when im bored af lol
Well I know you don't hold it in high regard but for leo you should  give it a view.
cool
Have a nice day
bye
Thanks, you as well. bye]
Have you seen this movie?
Yes, I have. 
I really enjoyed it. I love revenge movies
I as well, hitman movies are the best! 
Yes! And Keanu Reeves did such a great job
He always delivers! This movie had such an authentic B movie feel to it! 
Yeah! I loved it
I felt crushed when they killed his puppy though
IKR! Very violent film, destroyed a lot of stuff - how many black SUV's were trashed during the filming of this movie? 
HAHAHA! oh my god. SO TRUE! the infamous black SUV
I had totally forgotten that John Leuizamo was in this movie, he is like the ninja actor that shows up when you least expect it! 
Oh yeah! That's right. So many great actors in this movie
And they all looked so cool in their mafia suits
The movie has such an authentic criminal world feel to it. (cough cough) not that I would know what the criminal underworld looks like 
hahaha uh oh
oh and the Mustang was SICK!
The scene where the bad guy realizes that they just pissed off wick - priceless
I looooove mustangs
great selection of vehicles for the movie 
when a great assassain gets back into the business for revenge, ya'd better watch out! lol
hahah you know it!
it was a really fun movie
all behind a puppy! 
I would do the same for my dog in a heartbeat!
extremely  rare gem of a film 
Who was that lady assassain in the nightclub? Extremely beautiful   
Yeah, I'm surprised it only received a B rating on Rotten Tomatoes
kept rewinding her scenes! Great actress 
Ms. Perkins?
You know, sometimes the critics get it right and other times we just gotta judge for ourselves! 
That's her! 
Yeah I never really trust ratings. We all have different tastes. It's all subjective
That's Adrianne Palicki
Yes! I know her from other stuff, but she was too good in this movie. A great actress always makes you forget your watching a movie! 
yeah she was a great character!
Up uuuuuuntil she died. She broke the rules.....and rules are rules...lol
That last fistfight though! 
What do you think, better than Neo vs Agent smith? 
Wick went through the henchmen, and I was shocked when wick allowed himself to get stabbed! I literally said aloud "What are you doing?" 
Then I said "Oh, I see now!" lol 
I liked the final fight scene in Wick better than the matrix Just my opinion. 
and of course, at the end, wick gets a new puppy
what happens if the mailman accidentally maces' wicks' new dog? lol
haha sorry my internet got glitchy for second
but yeah! haha pretty funny
HI there! Have you ever seen this?
Hey! Yeah I have but it was a LONG time ago
what about you
It was a long time ago for me too, but I remember because all the dark knight movies came out afterwards
though they took forever to make those ones... or at least waited forever
I personally liked the dark knight movies way more
especially the first one
yeah, they didnt do a very good job of connecting the storylines
and christian bale wasnt my fav batman either
i don't think too many people like him as batman honestly
The voice he made was almost comical
the best part is he tried so hard on that voice too
hahaha I know
but i cant talk too much because i always get flack for like ben affleck
liking*
affleck>bale 
YAS someone agrees haha
what about tom hardy in the new ones?
I'd say he did better than both of them 
I agree!!!!
its been years but i still can't get over heath ledgers acting as the joker 
that was some next level stuff
Agreed. It took a lot of good ating to be as good in the role as jack nicholson
oh jeez my typing is awful today. acting*
lol you're fine
im not used to typing without emojis 
oh yeah me too. too much texting
you know who i did love in these movies tho?
who?
MICHAEL CAINE
TRUEEEEEE
He does so well as alfred :'D
you can't not like him
mhmm. good in children of men too
Didn't he have a cameo in one of the recent superhero movies?
Or am i thinking of someone else/
michael caine?
yea
oh god there are so many superhero movies now that i really couldnt tell you
good point lmao
u wanna know one superhero movie that im REALLY excited for
whats that
THE INCREDIBLES 2!!!
k I just talked about this yesterday
I've waited for soooooo loooooong
i am so excited and its taking way too long
yes!
i will push children out of the way to watch it
right at the end of the movie, we were like when is the next...ten years later...haha
hahahaha
I think we are allowed to end our convo now?
I have no idea honestly
Haha well Im gonna see, it was lovely chatting!!! have a great day!
John returns to the criminal underworld
I wonder if that was triggered by the death of his wife.
thats interesting
The movie sounds exciting
Yes very interesting
Are you a fan of Keanu Reeves?
It's an action thriller movie. I love action thrillers.
Me too. I also like mystery and adventure movies.
When do you plan on seeing the movie? or have you seen it already?
This movie deserves a follow up
I agree
revenge thrillers are intense
Yes they are.
It only only got 6.9/10 hmmm
Wow. Im surpried.
Made in 2014. Kind of old
Oh ok. Good to know.
I would have thought it was newer
I remember when the trailer came out.
It had a lot of hype around it.
Who returns to crime after the death of a loved one hmmm
No one in their right mind.
oh I should have know seeking vengence
Yeah. Revenge would be a good reason for some people.
They stole his car and killed his puppy, a gift from the dead wife.
Wow. T hats bad.
I hate torture in movies though
Yeah. Its very unpleasent.
I like action though like fighting
Yeah. Me too.
This role probably fit Keanu so well
I think so. He does well as an actor.
Ji
Hi
Hello
So what movie are talking about ?
The Wolf of Wall Street
Oh, I have heard a lot about that movie
I have never actually seen this movie so what I am reading is all I know about it. Personally it does not seem like a movie I would like. It seems boring and it was given a Cinema Score of C so that might support my opinion.
Oh okay. Who are the lead actors ?
It says the genre is a "black comedy". Do you know what that is because I do not. I'm thinking it is a "dark" comedy as in mood and attitude and not racial.
The lead actors are Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Kyle Chandler, and Rob Reiner. I do not know who Kyle Chandler is.
There are big names
I see it was based on a true story.
Leonardo was nominated for Oscar for this.
Where are you located ?
Oh he is a good actor, probably deserved it.
I'm located in Maryland. I thought we aren't suppose to give personal information.
Wolf of Wall street is pretty famous in the US.
It just seemed a little bizarre to me that someone didn't know that movie,so I asked.
Yes. I've heard of it but never seen it. I like action movies.
Okay. I recommend trying to watch it, it's a great movie.
I think my husband and daughter have watched it buy not me. Again, I like action movies but my husband loves watching gangster and comedies. He always teases me that I only want to watch action movies for the actors.
Haha, is he right ?]
I might have to. I am more of a book person so since it's based on a book written by the main character I would be more apt to read the book.
Yeah, sometimes he is right that is why I watch the action movies lol.
The movie is based on a book.
The summary of the movie seems kind of depressing. The main character doesn't seem honest and he gets arrested. I'm guessing he overall learned his lesson since he wrote a book about his life story.
It actually sounds sad to me. Someone that has the potential to make alot of money at work and ends up getting greedy and corrupt and ruins their life.
Yeah, the movie is pretty entertaining. The summary might have been written by an emo. Lol. The entire movie is fun, other than the last 10 mins or so.
Overall he ended up fine. Has a family and everything
He is on TV sometimes as a guest 
Oh well that's good. I see he went to jail for 3 years. That's not too long. I wonder if he truly regrets ruining his life or just regrets losing all the money.
He made that money quick and easy, while cheating the stock market.
He must be a really intelligent person, what a shame to waste all that talent.
3 years was nothing.
Yeah, 3 years is short.
Well, he still is a millionaire.
Oh wow. That I didn't know and it doesn't say. Except it says he hid $22 million in a Swiss account. Is that how he's still a millionaire?
Even if he lost all the money he made previously, his movie deal, book deal and speaking fees has made him millions
Do you know if he has a new family because it says his 2nd wife Naomi wanted a divorce and full custody of their children.
I don't know much in detail but ,I watched him talk about his daughter once and he seemed pretty happy about where he is now.
He does say that he has made mistakes in his life.
Oh well that's good. I do like movies (and books) based on real life stories.
Try watching it , its a good one.
Looks like we did good on the chat
I think I might have to. If it keeps my attention through the first 30 minutes I'll keep watching it. Sometimes I cheat and wikipedia movies to see what they are about before watching them.
yes, I think this is a good chat.
Let's wrap it up
Ok. 
Have a great rest of your day
Bye.
Thank you, you too. Bye

WHY DO DID NOT SEE THAT? DO YOU KNOW THIS MOVIE IS REALLY GOOD
WHICH CHARECTER YOU LIKE THIS MOVIE
I LIKE ALL THE CHARACTER IN THIS FILM
OH REALLY
THAT NICE
OK FINE
Hi there
hello
I love a good thriller. Especially one produced by Steven Spielberg
Yeah, he is great. The Post is one of the better ones which  has a lot to do with Tom Hanks
Hey! How's it going?
How did you like Iron Man?
Hi! I like the movie
Did you like it?
I thought it was fun too.
What was your favorite character?
Ofcourse it is Tony
He's hard to beat I must admit.
What was your favorite character ?
Probably Tony as well - he cracks me up with his deadpan humor.
I actually think it's the humor that helps the movie work out.
Yes he has very good humor and acts with ease
What element of the movie did you prefer, besides the humor?
Action sequences. I like the second movie out of all three parts
First movie looks more like a documentary/war
Yeah, the action sequence are pretty good. Love the flying suit!
Right. But it was a good way to establish the back story.
second part is my favorite with all sports cars in action, upgraded suit
yeah 
I know! All those shiny toys.
Usually, I
m not that big on gadgets like that, but t hey really make it work.
I think it's the sort of aesthetics they went for that works for me.
are you expecting another part?
sequel
Probably. They made so much money with those movies, why would they stop?
I think they made a billion dollars with those movies
yeah.
What do you think of the flirt/love sub story with Gwyneth Paltrow?
Honestly I don't remember that one..remind me where exactly it happened
I think toward the end. I thought it was unnecessary.
But you can see the love story coming from the start.
I find it annoying when they feel they have to add love stories to everything.
But her character still works besides the flirting.
See that's why I only remember war thing
I know - it's more fun to watch, more action-oriented.
What about the technology in the movies - do you like the way it's presented?
I loved the electro magnet in his heart.
oh by the way, I love his attitude in serious fights, humor with music
I know! He's one of the best actors for super hero movies because he doesn't take himself too seriously.
Gotta go now - fun talking with you!
Hi! How are you? Seen any good movies lately?
yeah, Frozen
Sounds like a cold movie! Can you tell me what it's about? 
Its about two girls Anna and Elsa
Anna is a princess
and Elsa is her younger sister
Gotcha! Is it a movie for children or adults or both?
Difficult to say, probably for both
Well I like kids movies just as much as adult ones sometimes! Did you really enjoy watching it? 
well,  its been acclaimed as the best musical made by Disney
I'm trying to find a good movie to watch tonight. 
Sounds like a hit then! Disney movies are always excellent. 
yeah, its also 3D animated, the visual are really good
even rotten tomatoes gave it 89%
Not a bad review for Rotten Tomatoes! I
Is it fairly new or a few years old?
well,  it came out in 2013
So fairly new. At least compared to some of the other Disney princess movies!
Can you tell me what the basic plot is?
Don't give too much away though! I don't want to know the ending!
ahaahah, ok
the plot is really good, magic things, talking animals, its exactly what we want from Disney
Perfect! 
I think I have found my movie for tonight! 
Thanks so much for your recommendation!
Sure, no problem! Its also very emotional, so you may need some tissues :)
All the best ones are tear jerkers! I'll be sure to have them handy along with some good snacks.
yeah, the ending is definitely not what you would expect it to be 
Is it a happy ending at least?
well, you have to see it yourself
not to spoil it
the only hint I will give you is that it gets "political" at the end 
True! I hope it's a happy ending! Is this a Disney movie that has a sequel?
actually, I don't know
Well since it's so new they may have not made one yet. But since it had such great reviews I'm sure they will! I
I'll tell you if I enjoyed watching it but I'm sure I will! 
Hello, what's the name of the movie?
Hi, it's the Imitation Game
Does it seem interesting?
Definitely, it takes place during WWII and it's decrypting spy code messages
Cool, is there a main lead actor or actress that's easily identifiable?
Yes, it stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightly, it's got a pretty good score on Rotten Tomatoes and CinemaScore.
Good to know, what studio is it produced by?
I'm not sure about that but did you know there was an earlier movie about the same book?
So  it's based on a book?
Yes, it's based on Alan Turing:  The Enigma and the earlier movie was called Breaking the Code, it was on BBC.
Good to know, although I didn't ask; does it say who starred in the BBC version?
No, but I've got info on a few of the key scenes if you're interested in knowing?
Absolutely, are the scenes taken from the book, the BBC version, or the movie?
From the 2014 movie with Cumberbatch and Knightley.  The earliest scene has Turing in boarding school being bullied, and he makes a friend there that gets him interested in cryptography.
That's cool, so it's sort of a biographical movie?
The next scene is when Britain declares war on Germany, Turing goes to work at a place called Bletchley Park that is trying to decode the Nazi's Enigma Machine.  Yes, it's a historical drama.
Do you want to hear the plot?
Does it mention how accurate the movie is as opposed to real-life events; that's why I was asking if it was biographical as opposed to simply historical?
Oh.  One of the critics says it rearranges the time sequences and invents fictional characters.  
Thanks for the clarification , are there any more excerpts?
Yes, the plot sounds really good.  Turing manages to decrypt the Nazi code machine, but the Nazis change the code every day.  So they all realize they can't act on every day's decrypted messages or the Nazis will know that their code machine is useless.
Interesting, does it mention how it's resolved, or does it leave you sort of on the cliff?
It kind of leaves a cliffhanger there.  There are a couple of twists, though.
Does it say whether the main characters survive to the end, or are they wounded, etcetera?
It doesn't tell.  One of the twists in the plot is that a Russian spy is discovered by Turing.  Which isn't surprising at first, but then we find out that British intelligence planted him to tell the Russians secrets they wanted them to know, after all Russia and Great Britain were on the same side in WWII.
That's sort of a twisted narrative of the political situation, but whatever, anything else super useful or interesting, (it sounds like a great movie)?
When I watched the movie, I liked the codebreaking machine they had,  It was this massive technical looking wall that was way before the time of WWII.  Yes, there's another twist in the plot where the Russian spy threatens to tell everyone that Turing is homosexual.
How did the spy know that Turing was gay?
Turing told the spy, because Turing was about to get married to Clarke (Knightley).  It sounds like high drama to me.  The spy (before Turing realized he was a spy) told Turing to keep his homosexuality a secret.  I guess they were pretty tight.
Wow, that's a big ol' ball of secrecy for that time period, is there anything else about the plot or whatever you should tell me?
Yes, at the end of the movie, the Allies win the war and the boss makes the cryptographers promise to never see each other again and they destroy all the code.  Also, Turing tells Clarke (Knightley) to leave because he is scared for her safety.  He tells her he is gay and that he never cared for her, which wasn't true because he was in love with her.
It got a pretty good score on Rotten Tomatoes.
What's the rotten tomatoes score?
Rotten Tomatoes is 91%, CinemaScore is A+, and Metacritic Score is a bit low at 73/100.
Hmm, not bad at all, does it say when it was released?
I think that about does it for this movie, do you think you'll see it?
in 2014
It sounds really good, more likely than not, I will; how about you?
I didn't realize I had already seen it until I started reading this.  I remember it was really good.  If a movie isn't good I usually don't recall it this clearly.
It was definitely a good look into what life was like during that horrible war.  It's been good chatting with you, I enjoyed.
Lol, likewise, I'm pretty sure we just do the exit survey at this point and tell them whether we want to see the movie, right? 
Hello!
What do you like the most about this movie?
I really enjoyed the music from this film!  What was your favorite thing about Frozen?
The songs
My kids love it
I also like that it was inspired by an existing fairy tale.
The animation was excellent and amazing!
Yeah, the animation and the plot is amazing
What is your favorite chARACTER?
*CHARACTER
Mine is Anna
Anna.  I'm a fan of Kristen Bell's other work as well.
I love her voice!
I like that Anna was fearless, and didn't act like your typical Disney princess.
That's right...she's extroverted and fun!
The first part of the movie, explaining how the sisters were orphaned, and how their circumstances drove them apart was tragic, but I do like how everything wrapped up in the end.
It's hard to believe this is Disney's 53rd animated feature film!  I'd find it difficult to even name that many Disney animated features!
Yeah, the ending  has a very special meaning
Do you have any other favorite film?
from Disney
A few, but I thought for purposes of this exercise, we must confine our conversation to the information in the document?
That's correct
What is your rating for Frozen?
The document is growing, and additional detailed information about scenes from the movie were just added.  I'm reminded of the scene where Elsa builds her ice palace.  It was an impressive bit of computer generated animation.
I would rate Frozen as an 80%, or 8 out of 10. 
Yeah, the animation was outstanding
My favorite scene is when Anna gets hitby Elsa  at the very beginning.
The Duke of Weselton has a name that looks suspiciously like the term weasel !
I like all the scenes with musical numbers in them.
What did you like the least about the film?
I did not like that the parents died
did you know that there is a scene where rapunzel appears in Frozen?
The parents dying was sad and unexpected, and a dramatic way to start the film
I did not know that Rapunzel appeared in Frozen. 
Yeah, very briefly
I have to agree it's the best Disney animated film in quite a few years... since the Lion King.
Yeah, the best film in modern animation.
Hi
Hi.  It told me to read this page first so I'll be just a minute.
Okay done reading.  Is anyone there?
Welp I hope I still get paid for this because I read the directions, read the movie description and am waiting here to chat I was directed to do.
The other person back out I am still here wasting my time so I hope that whoever checks this over is willing to pay me for holding up my end of the bargin.  Aborting conversation in a min if yall don't send me someone new to chat with.
Other participant left the conversation early.  
Hello! Have you seen the movie La La Land?
No I haven't.
What is it about?
It's really good! It's a musical/romantic comedy about two people who fall in love in Hollywood.
Who are the main actors?
Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are the two main characters.
Are they the characters that fall in love?
They are. One's a jazz pianist and the other is an aspiring actress.
What is the conflict?
There isn't really a major conflict, the movie just follows these two characters as they fall in love.
There are several dance numbers that are really well done.
Is it a musical?
Yes, it is a musical.
Are there any current pop stars who are in it?
They meet for the first time when he's playing a jazz improvisation and the music draws her into the restaurant.
John Legend is in the film.
Is it love at first sight? 
Kind of. She falls in love with his music, then gets to know him better and better throughout the film.
Who is the director of the film?
It's directed by Damien Chazelle.
Never heard of them. What other movies have they been the director?
He directed Whiplash as well, which is another film about music.
I like it because the characters are falling in love as they're following their dreams.
Do you know who does the choreography for La La Land ? 
I don't know.
What kind of movies do you like?
I enjoy things where I have to think. Or that have strange plot twists. Like Memento. Or Predestination. Where you don't understand everything until the very end.
Are there other movies like La La Land that you could compare to it?
Cool! Well then you might not like La La Land. It's a bit more straightforward and focuses more on relationships and the characters.
I like all kinds of movies. Are there other films that you could compare La La Land to?
It's kind of a unique type of movie. It has a lot in common with movies from the 1920s that have lots of dance and musical numbers.
It's very well-made. Lots of critics seem to have enjoyed it.
hi
Hello
how are you doing
Im doing great. Have you seen Toy Story before?
i did a long time ago
I love that movie 
yes it was a big part of my childhood
is was stared Tom Hanks as woody 
yes i like buzz alot
who was your favorite
buzz light year
yes i really did not care for the third one i never seen it
the director of the movie was John Lasseter dont know what else he made
me either
I never saw the third one either 
yes disney has mostly lost me on their movies
the first toy story came out in 1995.. wow that seems like such a long time ago
yeah  that's a while ago
when it came out the critics said it was a work of genius
i think that we both agree on that?
definitly
it got a 100 on rotten tomatoes that seems great
looking at the plot points made me remember some good sceens
yes it did the critics also said tom hanks voice of woody is one of the best animated features in history
yes
like when buzz was trying to impress all the other toys with his cool new modern features
yes that was great
was it this one when they go in that room with that baby toy
I cant remember I think so
i get confuse with this one and two
I remeber when there were trying to get on the moving truck
it was fun remembering this one
you have a great day
bye
well It was cool talking whit you have a good day
bless
yes
Hello
hi
The imitation game is a great movie
Hi!
Have you watched Blindside? You should totally watch it, it's a truly empowering movie about the struggles of a football player growing up into becoming a professional athlete.
Wow, that sounds pretty good.  What's the name of the athlete?
Michael Oher!
Ok. I don't recognize the name. Who did he play for in pro ball?
pro football, he was a offensive lineman for the Baltimore Ravens
Hm, that's cool.  So what kind of struggles did he have?
He was raised in an impoverished upbringing.
Its truly amazing, you should watch it
It sounds interesting.  Is it kid-friendly?  
Yes it is PG! It is very cute in the movie when Michael meets his new families young boy named SJ. they bond so closely together
Oh sweet.  It's always nice to find something the kids can watch with us that isn't some lame cartoon!  So he gets a new family? Is that kind of the main plot?
Yes it is, he gets a new family that is very wealthy. The mom loves Michael so much, you can really tell. She wants him to pursue whatever goal that he wants.
Sounds like a good story.  Who made the movie?
The director was John Lee Hancock
It's rated A+ on cinemascore
Wow, that's a good score.  Are there any famous actors in it?
Sandra Bullock is in it, she was praised for her job in it!
Oh I like her.  I'll have to check it out. 
Sandra's friends in the movie criticize the actor, wondering why she would adopt a black kid. Very empowering
Sandra goes against her friends wills, and keeps raising Micahel
That sounds like a really good message for our time when people are focusing on polarizing races.  It would make for a lot of good conversations with kids too.
So does the movie have a lot of football in it?
Not as much as you would think. Its about 25% football! A lot of the movie is about whats going on behind the scenes with his family issues
Michael gets into a fight with people back home, because that make sexual jokes about his new mom
Ah ok.  My husband really likes football so he might be interested.  I like sports movies when they have good character development.
Michael stands up for his mom, and gets into a fight
Sounds like a good kid.
Really? you would absolutely love this movie then, I'm surprised you haven't seen it yet. It's won many awards
Oh really? Which awards did it win?
I can't remember actually
Sorry!
oh ok, well I don't really follow the awards stuff anyway.  :)
What happened to him when he grew up? Did he stay close to this family?
Yes, it's a true story. He actually still plays in the NFL! 
I love when these types of stories are true stories
Makes it so much more real
Yes, I do too. My husband actually hates it when he finds out the story was fiction, so he'd like that too.
Hi. 'The Imitation Game' is based on a true story about code breaking in WWII. Great reviews.
don
it is about for good person
It is about good people. It's a thriller, but actually happened.

bhaijan greetings for eid
thanks a lot sallu
madarchod salman is a thief
no one will watch your movie
salman khan is earning money in the name of hindus and muslims .. shame ..
bhai will you not give a gift for eid
if you are a true muslim then do not watch this dogs film on the day of eid
this is the right time when our imaan will be tested
son of a kafir i will not watch your movie
son we come here less now otherwise earlier we used to stay here
salman bhai i also want to com
you didn't say where you're from
justice will also happen for you .. either here or there .. inshallha
sandhya salman will not talk
alisha sallu was not going to come to hat stop seeing dreams
even i am indian, who is he to abuse muslims and still call himself muslim jaheel
put this chutye in the bathroom and close him
sallu is best
bhai jaan is ready
salman i want the answer to my question, if we are inferior then who are you, you are also muslim right most reply
whom did you call inferior muslim, first look at yourself, you are where you are today because of muslims, understood. you threaten us, who will want to see such a movie
will have to wait
you are a true being human, this is the thing that's most different about you .. you look very smart but your heart is also pure bollywood and beautiful .. you have a clean heart
if you are a muslim and still you betray your religion, people who support him are the biggest kuffar. first give them dawath those who support that darinda, say ki what islam
there is a lot of love you won't understand
easvariyas ghost is still there then how will you find it
you are my heart you are my life .. my salman hai
child of gashti, being muslim you became a hindu, shame on you
congratulations to you for your party, allah is enough for me
i want that bajrangi bhaijaan film is definitely a flop

bhai people the biggest religion is humanity so follow that
this time BJP's dog, stain on muslims will come, on the day of eid wherever this dog comes, hit him with shoes and make him run, enter his house
which dog said this
this is what everyone wants that we fight and you people are doing exactly that
ashu singh what do you know
ashu yaar stop it
pk? if to worship god, we don't need a small idol, then why do you need a big mazjid, DHILE LAND KI PAIDAISHO
abdul raheem bhai he won't understand he is rude, he doesn't have manners, to explain to him is like playing a been to khde
ashu sing it must have happened to you in your mandira
bhupender panwar why are you asking mojsai who i am
yar ashu you are crossing limits, please stop, don't say such nonsense
ashu singh we can't understand what you said
till now there was a lot of strength in your laudo? suddenly it became loose?
@bhupendra panwer why don't you go to pakistan for 5 years?
go to pakistan you dog, your hindi is also not clean
aur har bhade ke tattuo se getting comment done every salman khan is a muslim 
so you mean every person who does bad things is muslim, great thinking bhai, my middle finger salutes you
the person who speaks silently he is real son of hijde ashu kutt
sonya khan is a hijda muslim who doesn't know her gender
sonya are you a boy or girl, i have some work for you
muslim don't attack from ahead, also like hijde, they attack from behind, look at pakistan, country of muslim hijdo
bhupander panwar is a hijda muslim
bhupender bro is right, i haven't seen a bigger chutiya than him in my entire life, he is chutiya number one
advance greetings for eid

why is there something wrong in the movie?
brother you remain tension free
Sj Soriful what did you say. if you like salman this much keep him in your house.
all these are rumours. dont say like this.
mobarak ied mobarak ??
now lets go and sleep. today is #juma. have to read namaz
Shahrukh Gouri that is wrong news. dont believe. he didnt say like that.
Just ask salman how much Roza was there
Ahana Khan ignore them they will never understand. if you say anything then they will start swearing you who teach us islam
and salman brother we will for sure not go to watch your movies. because you have sung horrible god's chalissa because of which muslim is embarassed. full month that is month, after reading roza namaz should we listen to this. what brother did you not get any other movies.
if salman is right then just once he should say in the media that he hasnt said this. simpal.
mamu if you receive my message so please tell me yes or no ple good morning

great indian army and salman brother
pak foje live long <3
brother what are these rumours about you. are the true or false
salman sir where are you please message me please
he will come back when he grows up. to infiltrate and to eat bullets
sir its the effect of your movies
not bad what is happening where are you
mulle saved a mulle
kashmir belonged to india and will remain india's. 
the ones who are being killed there are pakistani as well :P 
you dont know anything and yet you come to beg for money
Bande matramjai hindbharat mata ki jaind indai is greati love my india;->
$@lute ! to that dedication that lives in hindustan's heart
salman khan is madarchod randy's boy harami kafir
you should promote it with the same excuse
humantity and love are remembered first
hindustan is my foot. why are all of you abusing pakistan. have pakistanis churi your sisters? 
Good that indian army left someone. otherwise if they have their way they will call this child also a terrorist from pakistan and capture him
strange. but very well done. really feeling happy.
love you brother jiii salman khan
its doubtful that even after doing such nice work their hearts will have some love for us
if you ask for love, we will give you our life. if you ask for milk, we will give you kher. if you ask for kashmir, we will tear you apart. 
salute to indian army. if a child from india had gone there then pakistani army would not have returned
hi how are you how are you which anniversary do you have
are op logo bap bel
india army bad india army raped all women
he is sharing such pics only because his film is coming and he is promoting that
my friend people are all your fans but they are upset about the chalisa in your movie & got very happy listening to qawali
& you are helping so many people via being human
if you find the time, please reply to me my heart will be at peace
awesome. if all countries become smart like this then there will be no animosity remaining between them. plz #Being_Human
he should get hail of ten years
if it has been proven that muslims are being insulted in bajrangi brother jan then i wont stay your fan forever
ami tomake khub valobasi, i love u brother jan
you look like a lion in the picture and in real you look greater lion
shailly salman brother will come online at 3:30 lets see if he replies to you or me :p

if Salman khan is a muslim then he should repent to the lord and apologise for his crimes otherwise he will not get a place in the world and in the afterlife
who has the bravery of not giving salman a place in the world. salman's fans are with salman
who love salman do not love islaam

brother we always love u, and we all know you will never do anything that hurts someone.... always brother r8 or jo kartaha kisiko na kisiko vala hotaha.....
Salman brother we trust you..
how farigh are you guys why are you sending requests
Don't worry brother.. people who say keep saying just ignore... #Being_human_bajrangi_bhaijaan_6_days_to_go
ek the tiger was also a super hit movie, bro. But, if I lookup for your name, it comes as radhe
Dont worry, salman brother...we are not going to be fooled by him...the movie is really good
leave it, sir. This country will never learn to respect the feelings of others.
salman khan is a  rocking star
Some people will never understand and won't let others understand. They are useless themselves and make others like themselves. They will never understand.
Salman, you are nothing without us. You are a disgrace to pathans.
Salman brother, i was waiting for such a post. Thanks a lot, brother
This is not our time.
Salman brother, I already knew that all the news is wrong. After watching your film, we all know who is who.
We dont believe such nonsense. Keep up the good work.
You told everyone that we are humans. Hindu or Muslim. India or Pakistan. But, I don't know why people don't understand. But, one day, they will realize it.
Don't worry at all. Whatever happens, whatever people say, we are with you. Just waiting for bajrangi bhaijaan :) Love and respect from bangladesh
Firstly, I am muslim. Then, I am a friend of the brother. Bajrangi movie will be a flop. Mark my words.
Why are you all so worried about the brother's wedding?
Please sleep. Don't bore me, Alia Khan.
From my area, not even one boy will go to watch the movie.
Salman brother is tensed, just from the start HAHAHAHHA
What is salman?
Think before you take any action.
Salman brother, why are you messing with everyone. Just focus on your work, please.
Hey, please don't disturb my sister, people.
Wherever there is someone like you, there is some problem there.
Okay, Alia, Don't feel bad. I am not used to apologising.
Salman khan should change his name. He should change it to Salman Kumar, because he is a disgrace to Muslims.
even if there is nobody with you, I will always be there with you, Salman brother.
Salman Khan, I will fuck your sister. Your mother is a prostitute.
I love you, brother.
There is not a bigger superstar in the world than the brother.
Asshole, he is an enemy of Muslims. He has defamed muslims. Your money won't be useful to you in your grave.
It's okay, if that is the case...people who are creating rumors, they should not do it...Islam doesn't teach you lies.
Yes, i know that you are a generous and a positive person. i believe that because I felt that and observed that.
We will definitely watch bb.
Salman brother, this is because of all those people who want to bring your image down.
Yes, even if the whole world gets against you, i will always trust you, completely, till I die.I love you, salman brother.
Salman sir, you are lovely.
don't listen to others, listen to yourself...Dogs always bark when elephants walk.
Do you know, what is your religion. Neither muslim nor hindu.
Stop it people, will you make me cry? All of you are doing emotional talks :' lolz
Salman khan is sleeping peacefully, now. And here, everybody is fighting like a fish market. Please sleep, Salman lovers.
I won't ever go to a theater to watch Salman's movie. I will watch it on the internet when it comes after 10 days for free.
Sir, I really hope to meet and talk to you.
A person has no cast, aj. don't worry.
Salman's father is an asshole.
don't say that about sir.
All hail, all hail, all hail, bajrangi bhaijaan
So, what should we do
Is salman from Indonesia
All the people who are abusing Salman, are two faced people. everyone is spreading wrong messages.
Brother, you said the right thing...we all are similar.
King of kings, Salman khan
Brother has 2.3k comments, 33966 likes and a great 300 crore movie.
Waiting for the brother.
Don't worry, brother. We all trust you. This film will earn 300 crore.
Brother, these messages are trying to turn your muslim brothers against you, to take revenge from you.
Sir, I hope to meet you one day. I will hug you, sir.
Sir, i really am a big fan of your movies. I love all your roles. Sir, please call me.
Salman, your truth is really nice. God will fix everything. Don't get too tensed up. Stay blessed.
We will make it a hit without muslims.
Eid is on 19th and he will surely come to collect his eidi.
Do you even celebrate eid and fast for ramzan, because eid is fun only if you keep the fast for ramzan.
Man, just because sllu brother is a nice person, everyone wants to just ruin his image.
Hello sir, will you ever talk to me. There is something, I want to share with you.
Salman brother... don't worry, we are with you... we don't care about all this...whatever people say about you.
Ok, there is no problem at all, salman brother.
Sallu, I want to know this from you. Why did you just talk about hindu brothers? Muslims also love you by their heart.
I'll buy that purse, use it, put some money in it, gift wrap it and then on the day of eid,after namaaz will gift this to my mother and wish her eid.
I knew that sallu could never say such bad things.
Brother, i'll spend tonight with you.
God is with you, brother.
Brother, whatever you say, that will happen.
I know sallu. I don't believe any fake news. Don't worry.
Hey, salman brother. When can we meet?
We'll spend Eid 2015 together, bajrangi bhaijaan.
Love you, love you, love you, sallu.
I'll throw you an eid party, brother.
You were not wrong, are not wrong and will never be wrong.Everybody in the world is waiting for your marriage. When are you giving the good news?
Brother, love you.
Hi salman sir, please, before i die, i wish to meet you. I have seen you in films but have near seen you in real life. I wish you and your family happy eid.
Brother, please talk to me once. I have been watching your movies since childhood, and I consider you as my big brother.
What will you do before leaving?
Love you salman...you are very great...everyday someone says something about the other...nobody can trust these people...from them, we should learn the importance of studying and the importance of thinking before speaking.
English is fucked by these people, brother.
Very good, brother. I am understanding your point a little bit.
Sallu brother rocks.
Salman sir, we know.
we believe you, salman
Bhai, we trust you completely and we know you won't do anything wrong.
SK brother, when are you going to get married, i want to see your son.
Salman sir, we always just follow you. After seeing yo only, we have learnt what it is to help others. It makes you happy, now we know.
We consider your as our own life.
What happened?
Salman brother, don't worry. We'll slap them so hard that they will forget, from where to breathe and from where to fart.
Brother, don't worry.
Love you, salluu.
Whoever wants 1000+ likes on their profile picture, add me and message me. Only for indiands.
Nice, sallu brother.
We trust you, brother! You can't do anything wrong!
Bajrangi bhaijaan, 700 crore!!
I am with you.
Don't say anything to Salman brother. He does not listen to anyone. He only does whatever he wants to.
Noman, your mother is there.
Salman, please reply sometimes, that's how we will know that you love your fans.
salman brother, please send me friend request.
Where are you, please? PLease, message me once. I really miss you.
Yes brother, we are with you.
We have no problem with your real life.You are an actor and we watch your movies. Rest, do whatever you want in your real life.
That's good, brother. Good evening, salman sir.
Marry soon, otherwise you won't be able to, soon.
Won't be able to marry, what else.
Niki varma, you should also say.
Salman, drive the car carefully now, otherwise jail...
Huh! What will this mother fucker give, I will fuck his mother, if I ever meet him. He is an enemy of Islam. I will bring him to the road and shoot him, that will get me to heaven. Because this motherfucker is an enemy of Islam.
I know. This is all fake news spreading these days. But this can affect the film. You should share a video on whatsapp, saying that you did not say anything against muslims. Hopefully, everything will be alright.
My wish is that I want to do friendship with you.
Salman brother, when will you marry? I want to dance at your wedding reception.
Salman, what have you written. I can't understand anything.
Salman brother, you are in our hearts.
I love you, brother. I am so sad about your arrest.
Hi brother, I wish you eid and good luck for your film bajrangi bhaijaan in advance. Love you, brother.
My islam, my religion. One god, one quran. How will you understand us?
So, I will come to your home, brother. Can i come to eat biryani. brother?
Brother, me and the whole of kolkata will watch your film for sure.
Please all firends, watch the movie. Brother has presented this for us. Everyone, please watch this movie.
My chances of watching the movie seems very low.
Brother, kidnap him.
These people call themselves fans but they can never be fans, because they never tried to understand brother.
Please, everyone who is a fan of bajrangi bhaijaan...if you are brother's fan, then gift eidi to bhai by watching his film.
Salman brother, don't get tensed. Your movie is going to be a hit. There are some assholes who are trying too hard, and those who are doing this, even they will watch your movie. But, it is their habit, they have a bug in their brain... :)
These are all fake talks. Brother respects all the religions and he does not hurt anybody, ever. Don't miss the movie, bajrangi bhaijaan. I will surely go for first show on first day.
We will show you your place in the future.
Pak movie is a flop?
We will watch brother's movie, first day first show.
Brother, don't get tensed.This bad thing is done by someone who is not your real fan. We have faith on you, brother.
I believe you, of course... I believe in your heart... always buddy, always...I love you <3
I really want to meet you, brother, anyhow. It really bothers me now and I can't take it no more. If you can understand, then please meet me. Your fan geeta rawat.
Salman, your fans come first, not your religion...they like you because you consider yourself an Indian, first. Whatever religion your fan is following, you are their hero, salman.
Today's party will be on brother.
Hi, bajrangi bhaijaan.
being human's real face. Salman brother, you and your father take blessings from millions of fans. Awesome...awesome. Stay blessed, always. admin aamir ahmed.
How are you, salman brother. You are awesome, pandey sir.
Salman brother, I can understand you and this is all a lie.
People's work is just to spread rumors.
Muslims are defamed in this movie.
I am fully sure that this movie will break all the records.
That's not a problem. I know that you are very busy all the time. All the best, brother.
The reply to the I love you will come when you can't even say anything.
Goodnight, salman khan. I wish that you replied.
Salman brother, I love you. Nikhil raj. Send request to hemanshu raj nikhil, salman brother. Please please.
Rather than drinking a lot, just drink a little bit, but without water. That will save water as well as money. What say?
No muslim will watch this film. This film will be a flop.
Sir, I am a very big fan of yours. Please reply to me once, also.
Brother, don't worry.
What are you saying? What do you know, what is an anti religious film.

I don't know but I want to ask. People are saying that salman said that to make his movie a hit, i don't need muslims...if that is the case, then why are you releasing the movie on eid. Release it after eid.
I am a big fan of salman khan. I am a pakistani. Love you, salman khan.

Favourite salman khan, brother. Happy eid.
In this film, Salman has made a lot of insults about Hindus. Salman has fucked up Bajrangi. same to same as PK.
You have done a very wrong thing, Salman brother. You have gone against muslims.
You are great salman sir...you're first a good human being, and after that an actor...I hope that you won't pay attention to these shameful statements about hindus and muslims.
Salman, who are you? Asshole, fuckface...do you read namaz just once?...And you are still unmarried, dick.
This film will be amongst one of the most flop movies of 2015. No muslim will watch this dog salman's movie.
Your mother's and your sister's ass, mother fucker.
Woow! Bajrangi bhaijaan will be a superhit movie...I wish from god that this film will be a super hit movie.
Broher, movie will be a block buster.
Awesome, boss.
Happy eid, brother. I miss you, i miss you.
I hope god helps you in releasing your movie bajrangi bhaijaan in the theaters in the south.
Just the trailer gave me immense pleasure, brother. Hellp.
Fuck, when is the film releasing?
Salman, brother, it is just you who is ruling the industry, no one else.
Salman sir is just mine...is it not, salman? And for that i will do anything...
Will this picture of our brother be a hit? I doubt.
Brother, that cute girl kid is looking more cute with you than kareena does.
Brother, be ready. Tomorrow, first day first show. Nothing can stop me.
I feel ashamed to call myself a muslim.
Salman, you dog. You are just against islam. You have no shame at all.
I hope your movie flops very badly. Bajrangi, go and change your cast first.
Happy eid to you, brother.
yo, hit, hit and hit.
Lol, asshole, you insulted our muslims. God will punish you.
Thank you, brother...Till today, this is the most beautiful gift...Bajrangi bhaijaan...

You be a saint, right now. Your brain is fine. You are not understanding, now but the day, when someday else will take me after my marriage, then you will understand. Right now, just sit.
Hello brother, where are you?
Wow, brother.
If you can do it, then do this.
Tomorrow, we will be able to see salman's stardom.
Hangover of your memories.
Why did you name the film Bajrangi bhaijaan, sallu brother?
Awesome look, brother.
Asshole, sallu brother became bajrangi during the month of ramzan. Dog, asshole, sallu...listen my muslim brothers and sisters, this time also, we'll make a fool of sallu brother.
Hi sir, bajrangi has become a master of two, dog.
Salman brother, you tell me what are all the wonders of India. One is Taj Mahal, what is the second one?  I want your answer. You say that you read all the comments.
Salu brother, tomorrow I'll come to meet the brother.
Brother is best. Brother, your film will be successful. Only salman brother.
There is no answer.
Bugger off, salman.
Hello, salman brother. How are you? I am good.
I love you, sallu brtoher.
Don't forget to watch it tomorrow.
Call everyone a kid, except me. Ok
Brother's brother.
I am salman's lover. Love you, salman sir.
What asshole people, who are wishing this asshole happy eid. What would this asshole know about ramzan and the reason to celebrate eid...he just cares about the money.
There can't be anyone like Bajrangi bhaijaan and his movies are awesome.
That is possible only when you will tell us, when are you coming to pak? Where will you stay and how can I meet you? I promise that after that I won't disturb you to call me. Just meet me once, please.
Please marry, brother.
What it is this weird world, muslim brother. They are calling kafirs good and great.

Handsome Sallu <3
Rafu, I don’t want to say anything more to you.
Your movie becomes a hit, I hope.
Am I not important to you, also? 
Hi, why are you behaving so badly?
Buy gold and silver shares and forget about them. If in the future, anybody wants to do such businesses, then sell those shares and buy the original ones. Otherwise, it will remain the same.
Don’t ruin fb by uploading photos of Salman.
I have heard that you people read comments :* <3
Congratulations brother, your movie is earning 1000 crore. Today’s party is on you.
All the best+Happy Eid to Salman, Lots of regard to elders+lots of affection and love to young!
You did awesome, bro.
Motherfucker, your movie became a super duper flop! Bahubali Rocks. :)
Asshole, First take my dick out of your mouth, then only you will say something. 
Bro, you didn’t do the right thing by giving muslims a warning.
Salman, I love you, please come to my city. Please, I love you, Salman. Please, come please.
I hope you don’t get any sadness in your life. I wish to God you smell like a flower. I hope your name stays till the end of time. I hope god blesses you with eid’s happiness.
I want to meet Salman Khan. Please help me.
Will you talk to us?
Salman’s movies always rock, friends.
Brother, I am a big fan of yours. I am saying this from my heart…Tell us, who is our brother? sallu brother…happy jumaa. Wishing you all the best for your new movie...
I hope I was your special friend and I wish I could be close to you. I wish I could be close to you from moments to moments. Congratulations. Your roja.
Happy eid. Love you, Salman.
All hail! Bajrangi bali will break enemy’s penis. Saw first day first show. Amazing movie.
Salman sir, Do you also celebrate happy eid. Please, tell us, please.
Love you, Salman…What are you doing? You should sleep…
I am superman but salman’s fan.
Sallu brother, my no. is 9861674485, this is the question of my respect, brother.
Hear touching movie.
You are looking very cute.
Brother, my sim is docomo. I have tried a lot. It is not happening.

just like you farmer is also doing hard work but he cannot raise his children
we consider ourselves fortunate that the country found a PM like you jay hind
the country is with you the iron man
sir i'm a small fan of yours but i can do anything
which randi's child
i need 5 lakes to start my bussnies
our country has gotten freedom because of you
look at bihar once
modiji we have a request that we want to open an organization that will help with private matters of people
the entire world is looking at bharat today
Bharatmata lovely son modi jaihoo
what happened to your promise, that swear, that decision
modi ji you are looking nice
please help us guard people first, then do big big tasks
destroy these enemies together
dont trust coro and dogs
sir please improve jhansi's electricity provisions thank you
sir you launched skill development programme which helped crores of people to get employment
sir please get clean bharat mission from villages to cities. sir give the responsibility of the mission to the municipality thanks
everyone's support everyone's development. good
will bihar's youth remain unemployed modi ji. bihar's youth is getting trampled in their dirty politics
p m sab help ips abitabh thakur 
govt should make strict rules for development
dear prime minister do something for jobs as well. only dancing will not help employment.
modi saab g,, will you keep making galla da krah or will you do something too

house house modi only modi. where people stop thinking modi ji start thinking.
modi jorj go ahead we are with you jai bharat

modi ji your sv asakeam is fail
your skill scheme is very good when people will learn how to work so they wont remain unemployed.. thanks to pm for it

why does everyone want to develop country by increasing price of petrol and diseal
bikaner's situation is bad. try walking on the road that leads to surdhana gav
make india digital modi government pm

modi ji. this is wrong that you are putting a stage worth 3 crore. please think about it
i have never heard any PM talk about ITI's development I think that good days are getting started
respected pm ji your future plans are very good i salute you
bharat is with modi
great modi ji, no one else is like you
mission is good just the implementation should also be good

if modi ji had become pm 10 years ago then today india's picture would have been different maybe it would have been equal with china
do it on the ground stop doing this rubbish. till now there has been no effect on people's lives. go to the ground to get feedback on any plan or policy. launching policies and giving money doesnt help the people. because there are a lot of people who eat in the middle

look at BJP Youth's skills in the below video
sir ji namaskar, some of the politicians of our party (BJP) have ruined the image of the party, and they should be removed from their positions in this case. so that no one else repeats it, jai hind, vandematarm
sir we are with you
sir whatever the reason for your travel if you improve odisha's electricity then something good will happen and what you said can never happen just improve the electricity
every country should get a PM like you, who works so hard for their country's future, and launches schemes like this. i salute you PM JI
we request all congressio that they take admission in skill india and learn some work. empty mind is a devil's workshop. dont think that ghotala is your skill.
india will become skilled when india will remain modi g. somewhere seej fire and somewhere isi. naksal waad. jai hind.

My sleeping hours have increased.
I have to go now , there is a meeting.
Just bcz of that level increase I could not understand anything in the beginning .
I do not even know how to properly manage tym
Do not touch your phone in the classes
You are delaying it  and then will delay your time to study
Right now its your time to sleep ?
I have generally observed that if you give half the time with concentration then work gets done
See, it's okay, if you follow it honestly.
Tell your schedule, what do you do all day?

If you work hard for one year then you will surely get goodresults.
If it is happening in a decent college then it is okay
There are so many people dropping in my college
Both of my best friends had taken

See its fine about the weather . Do you really think that the board exam went  bad because of the weather?
Actually there were a lot of scenes this time.
First the board exams and then the weather was really better.
Like taking a drop is not the advantage if you do not think you wil study next year

Girls ensure farewell dates so that everyone is around.
But that is kind of okay, nowhere as much fun as the actual farewell.
But no one raised a issue on the weekend.
Finalize the date now!
That includes weekdays.
Previous form was for this thing only.
I'm not asking for consenses on weekdays.
There will be no consensus on which day to keep.
Should have asked the unavailable on this form to fill weekdays too.
Then we'll have to ask who isn't available on which day and so on and so forth.
What was the problem before March?
If you want to do damage minimizatio only, then consider March also I mean.
This is only logical, to minimize the damage.
Yaar one guy gave a suggestion somewhere.
Even if all the faculty and all the students agree, 
Arre, it's fine only, if someone has a issue, they'll speak up. 
Now if the people who make arrangements will cry then?
But first let's see if everyone agrees?
First of all, let's figure out if there is no problem with weekdays.
And really, is my reason selfish?
I have not even seen this in the past year.
I will watch the video
Can not reschedule the entire events due to one now.
One would think that your exams are going on.
When do you want to talk together once about syllabus?
I'm here during my summers.
So let's do it before if you want.
Some people of that wing are also staying.
If this is cool, I will make a group
But first, tell me, is it looking fine?
Exams are at the same time.
There's no job, she's saying
Yes, hope she doesn't have to take.
Yes, known brand only we'll order.
Since different photos don't have privacy settings.
Share the album with Friends only.
I'm in the lab, I'll come to the room and change.
Such bad jokes shouldn't be cracked.
Will see and then discuss it tomorrow
I'm surely going to the festival .
Numbers are rising like dogs.
With me 30 type people are going
Then lets assume today if when I get hurt I will get it done tomorrow
Yearbooks are made by us only or does the junior batch make it?
Ask on group?
Is there any slambook being made for our batch? 
That's why such questions are being asked.
I mean, anyone took the photograph of the jump or jump site?
I had made some changes , but they caused some errors.
They've carried forward through the rest of the code.
I'll fix it, but it'll take some time.
If I don't do the project in summer then will my workload increase next semester?
So I am collecting information.
It is believed that she also gets work done.
How much you want to go also matters.
We've to compare both the stories.
How do we detect sarcasm? 
Currently I am uploading the same.
Nothing is opening on my laptop.
Now how do I convince someone that the movie is bad.
Submission is day after tomorrow even though the presentation is in january.
Got to work on the project today.
I'll email by naight whatever i have done till now.
How is your animation work going on now
Something made from the tutorial
Is it for Linux in Windows?
For a command line, a shell script will be run right?
Here you will have to go to the command line repeatedly ???
So you will get net
Well one thing is that this thing just works in Chrome
i am just trying for the video file
Keep in mind that the code will not be repeatedly compiled in flash.
Then I will google what else we can do.
Abbe send what we have submitted in our name
should i post for tomorrow?
if i take off for 2 consecutive days i will die of shame.
So I thought maybe you're remembering me
What is the line
Tomorrow i will go with just the hostel people.
How's the weather now ?
Is there any registration deadline right now?
See u tomorrow evening
I just have to control my eating
Leave the human level
we will not go to the complete end
Watch this section
I have to study as well, what is all this?

Anyway,you know our marriage could not have happened
Hmmm
Yes that's also the matter
You know Nikhil brother, he would have killed us
By the way he was a Scheduled Caste, and that would have been a lot of trouble, it is good that he is getting married somewhere else, otherwise my family would have killed me.

There is a wedding today at home.

Sister's marriage and I am not There
Bombay's Uncle's Daughter's
Good brother
When are you coming
I will land on 9th
Morning
me too but lets go early today and see :P
let me call her
it's light right now, i'll try attending one myself.
It's great if attendance gets marked.
I will come to the wedding tomorrow directly
I might not stay in the room tomorrow as well, can its booking be cancelled now?
Sorry , did not know until this morning that I wouldn't be able to come today
I was really trying to come
but if its possible and any other guest needs a room, give my room to anyone
So we will get a train ticket today.
Haha off course, I'm sure the car will be useful to go to each other's houses
btw I was thinking I would go home first, and come to Venue in the evening
I can happily do research and continue the foreign interviews easily now
Keep kettle outside when you wake up
So have your brother's function some other day
See tickets will become so expensive that then you will not book them
You come here after making a permanent arrangement!
Imagine how many gujju from our college will be left sitting
Yes but the fridge is empty
There was so much noise in Goa that we were remembering Gokarna
I am doing timepass
Then she became a very good friend, used to call for dinner every day
Have gone for a walk in 0 degrees also
Last sem I was very interested in hostel cooking
What nice shakes and cold coffee can be made with that
I opened daddy's fb yesterday and put profile pic
by the way, keeping it in group is a good idea too.
Please put pictures of their side also
I have the recipe of what I made that day , Whose photo was sent .
So let's meet outside their home at around 11 oclock
Do it and tell what happens.
There is no plan right now, but will keep you posted.
There's so much work in weddings
Tell me how to take urgent medical leave?
You took it for your throat last sem ?
Send the comic con photos from your phone !
Just have to fill the basic details and click Next Next
And is there such a doc for placement / intern this year ?
Till last month, timepass was going on
I find it awesome that half of the people are living with the wing people !
Yes we all are going to study in your wing!
He hasn't been working on my previous paper so that's also left 
if you're using laptop then see what I've posted on the group !
Sometime i'll make you sit down and just tell me phrases and it'll be awesome
One of my subjects has end sem, and it has the most problems
Let's hope that major chunk gets finished.
Collect all the awesomeness.
The seniors were in another block, they thought juniors are bursting crackers, we will also burst them.
Another diwali was celebrated in the entire boys hostel.
And then the whole wing used to try to lift me.
Shit, I should tell my wingmates that they should learn how to lift me from you.
Later I emailed again, to give the internship again.
And once, just for your satisfaction watch some Turkey News
I don't think there specific issue regarding women
istanbul is safe in general if you dont go to places you're not supposed to ( which is true with most cities )
Everyone in the office speaks English so there is no tension
I'll refer by word of mouth and I'll send your resume along
But I do have to work at a startup sometime.
Do you have any idea about the company?
cliche dialogue in response to a cliche dialogue
I check whether money came or not four times a day
Like even though they're going good , They are not getting calls ?
So far the list of second set of ppl has not come
I dont really know how these things work but I thought of you when I saw this ..
I have ditched you twice, call me whenever you want to
Your office will also be Hyderabad, will it not?
I do not think its in our fate to meet before placements
Whoever has my LAN wire, please return it.
Those who had gotten the mess exemption last sem, either comment or ping your tricks
If hostel doesnt have electricity then come to lab :P
there is stale air for you here
If anybody has downloaded then reshare
Does anyone have any idea about topology's grades
Does anyone else have random sports equipment due ?
Those who did not get it signed talk to sir and come, there will be surprises
did you come to know who is the room mate? 
You will be missed, for the little things
There will be only 7 people for birthday's 12 oclock treat
Does anyone else sometimes think that we are studying in an art college?
Like the final answer should be workoutable 
I will tell in detail, in a while
By then the company will come on campus I think
It is not easy to create dataset .
But we will have to try, so lets see where this goes !
Hey check pm
we have already started , no ?
I am telling for helping out the rest
What're you guys working on now ?
I just drank a strawberry smoothie :D
Where did you get Strawberry Smoothie from?
I have blender so I used that to whip me up some breakfast :D
I wish any new movies would have come
hey , watch the old ones !
I watched masan yesterday, it was awesome.
before that i had seen drishyam
and then i watched talvar
I have to watch talvar since a long time

I saw them arrive, one after another, there were so many trucks
Any idea if they are making something ?

I hope you will enjoy in gym.
The trainer was a bit weird though, I am assuming that there will be a different experienced trainer 
New Girls Hostel is being constructed
That's why trucks are coming, I think
Where have you joined gym?
Its in indranagar , right above cafe cofee day .. 
She has taken the quarterly subscription directly in confidence

I am typo queen
In addition to spelling, I will make grammatical mistakes also
We are filling useless data for you
I will always be grateful to you people for all the help
the most important thing indian metal act needs to go forward is for people to buy their stuff and attend concerts
plus for books I think that for so much movie i give 150 rs to watch in hall
That doesnt give such rich and immersing experience that books give
im sorry i pinged you so late at night , did not think about it
for summer, she has taken
he has said that if i do well then he'll take me for my thesis also .

Falling of heavy bricks will get you more points, so a smart person will put heavier bricks at the bottom
I am praying that something strange does not get announced on the mike about me .
Will you also have different material whose castle you will make ?
Because the donkeys, on the day of the flight, told that it is overbooked, come tomorrow 
I am checking the paper dude while I'm sitting.
That is why 1 tied seat was kept separately while Elections happened
Now if you get in here, then quietly do research.
I started getting hit dude when I was roaming with him !! 
Hey if you do his rules only, than you will fail.
So much time was spent in explaining Lambda calculus 
Quietly blast this paper, else you will get beaten. 
By tomorrow evening, hopefully enough portion will be done.
I was scared that the guard does not catch me, so I had to check whether he was in the room or not. 
you guys could have not stood against each other .
Maybe I was upset and not in the mood to talk to anyone
did you end up going to Exhibition ?
And how big a dataset do you want?
I went for 15 minutes
Sure , After the 9th deadline she is available
I wonder how she would be able to work in the office today
she was up all night because she had a flight
I can see how much effort you are putting to make this data set bigger
Obviously, hard work has to be done to get something!
Does anyone want something from US?
YES PLEASE bring CHOCOLATES HERSHEY COOKIES AND CREAM
I love that chocolate as much as I love Adele singing
Yes sure whatever you have written now
The code is mixed only.
So I realized this past week that it is very difficult to find Hershey's chocolate in Bangalore.
You are so good and smart ^_^
Yes , it's quite difficult in hyderabad , as well
Twix and toblerone are kept in bulk in pretty much every place . 
i forgot to ask , did you find hershey's in Karachi yesterday ?
No, somehow it wasn't there
They are kept near the bread
Your layover will be in Dubai .
You can bring alcohol many many .
No I was making a sentence in which there is Hindi and English.
A little proper dataset was created through small talk and nonsense.
Otherwise useless shit only must be filled in that .
I have got a strange cold.
Hyderabad getting cold in this weather is just extremely weird as shit
What is the meaning of strange cold?
Everyone make some spllng mistakes too
Hey, it's that thing where desert comes in one nostril and floods come in another nostril .
The airlift is getting started
In Forum mall, I am sitting on recliner seats .
For d 1st time
Have you paid 250 or else just taken the seat?
I am sitting on it for the 1st time , and I paid for it .
I'm having trouble typing in SMS language
alright , movie begins , c u l8er
Haha have fun in the movie
I'm starting to train on 1.1 lakh pairs
Then he would generate 1, 00, 000
English also should have normalization
The data will also be easy to work with
Whether someone else puts or not, you must submit one paper of yours, you need a full paper with your first author in it 
Lemme know when you are in the lab . 
please send whenever you have time
What is to be done for some thesis, or how much work is sufficient for this , etc ...
Yes , see for yourself too , that'd be a lot helpful
Now it is difficult to get back the papers from the cell, I will send it to you in the night
You were saying no , you have some pointers and all .
Going in the hotel, whose name should be taken for the room ?
Among the 26th and 27th events, no event is in the Open Air no ?
But the college ones almost all are from outside , so I have the booking for them .
What are you saying? I'm not sure >_>
i was waiting till last moment that if someone was going to Hyderabad with me, then I would have done that with him. 
So you can transfer his dues here if you wish .
it looks similar to the collection of all the tablets that paan wala has
And non-veg people liked their bacon macaroni
If you are up for it, then i might have a tiny gift for you
People eat and leave after the playy
Their happy hours are pretty awesome btw .
Ping him once , he should inform you about it better and yes , you might get company
The samosas of the canteen were good and the lemonade too
We can play Board games ...
I have pinged him separately
But it is a pretty cool feeling being on the guest list
So the people inside are anyways in the mood to eat and drink
Yeah, if I speak for myself, then it would anyways look awkward
I loved their music even though I had not heard anything till felicity .
I am in the mood because I know they're a great band .
I have to go tomorrow, and there is a presentation tomorrow too
See check the question leniently please
Highest will not exceed 24, because that's the bar set by sir
Maybe they have to finish checking till 17th
Do you think we can give it till the day after tomorrow ? >_>
I am looking for it on the programming club group but I cannot find that post.
If he does not come in a day or two, I'll call them.
So far my Amritapuri's team has not been confirmed.
I had done a little bit of graph theory .
I thought it was to be compared with sum
Do you want to do long papers or will short do ?
She is already doing for herself
Oh actually he had kept the papers shortlisted 
So has someone approached you already .. ? Otherwise I'm alone as of now .. !!
Which comes later, I will upload later
So, start collecting pics soon !!
We should start collecting the entries ..
You won't have onions right ??
Are you making sandwiches ?
Crying of the same old placement
Just in case I have missed telling you, I have burned my hand
i think research portal has to be filled
I woke up a while ago and remembered you wanted to wake up at 6 .
I did't sleep in the wait for your update
Just prepare nicely as much as possible .
I don't know I was transferring sim from my phone
I needed a chat masala then
There are some Indian companies in that where batch people are there
Yes, I made a little list that where all I can get referrals
I wanted to ask you whether you will live in your old room or would like to shift to another room.
Means, if one word is the last word of a sentence, then you shouldn't make a bigram of it and the first word of the next sentence .
Tomorrow class may not be there, ma'am is out of town.
From tomorrow, we will go running again please :/
Put on headphones , go to sleep while listening to good music
Well, I feel around 7 in the evening is a good time.
Hey like my comment, not his post!
I'll tell you after coming back if I come on time
haha , mereko also must be studying , because she was not in the mood to get up !
Do you want to eat sandwich now btw?
There are also different coupons for different shops
whatever ive ordered will come in the afternoon , who will pick it up then
So , okay , I don't need to get bread then right ?
i am just worried about my stuff , it's kept on 2nd floor in the store room
I had taken permission from Dean before coming
And why is it like this, can we not copy anything from anywhere?
I need to know , did you ever get to know both copied the same thing from some online resource
If you find him then bring him also if he wants
Well did you file this income tax return?
Even I got scared for a second ..
But I was banking on the fact that traffic would not be there
Sorry due to such laziness, we will have to run in the end
Now it is fun, let us just do the arrangement for getting out of college
Sorry man mentor has suddenly gone madder
Next year I will ask you only where all to apply ?
Mine ended long ago , so I haven't been looking out for any 
Do not take tension, in the end I'll come in the train 
One question there is a drama in the customs, that is why do you have a rough idea how much stuff can we carry ?
From here the closest office is 5.6 miles away .
By the way do you know the SSN office is very close to our housing
I saw her going , so I thought you would be with her .
Oh you said that you would come today , so I told him that you left .
Hmm good thing that parties have started now
There is no conflict in the course registration no ? 
Haha come on, get well soon, otherwise I'll finish the nachos 
I'll tell you when i can eat nachos again, bring after that only
So much excitement would have been there while packing itself XD
Heeheeeeee . Glad to know that someone is doing good work in the holidays
btw , tell your batch people to apply fast if they want to ..
Then we will get done with their interviews today only
Oh and next year there will be small small first yrs .
Talk a lot to them , okay ?
Hehe .. I had joined it with the inner side with red electric tape
Is there a trouble eating there?
Let me know if you need anything from the market
Is aunty making lunch today or tomorrow ?
Mom is going on Monday morning
And I was hoping that I would get some interviews  
Tomorrow I'll sit and apply for 50 more companies
Told to decide the meeting time
Now the paper and all is done now chill in the holidays :P
The plan to do booting that you remembered sitting on the bus
Now it is late anyways what only can come
So I was under the assumption that everyone is reading the chat
They have swapped amongst themselves maybe.
Do not be curious now ping through messenger sometime
I was asking you in case you have pinged her about it ...
Many people have not filled the questions docs .... put a reminder in all of them once !!
Specially once you've celebrated that you have gotten a job and all
And if it is not found, then they will rescind the offer ?
I had gotten my visa in March .
So what was the process of off-campus ...
Some people were asking ....
Just that you guys work very hard for the placement people.
You guys deserve thanks every time
Whoever registers on the portal, they will pick up everyone's resume . 
His code is torn ... will have to look properly
But I'm applying a lot off campus , and if in Jan I get some nice place outside then I'd be taking that up .
So I have to apply to companies because very few people get H1B .
For the London office, people were selected separately
I have a question - if we get campus placements then we have to accept them , is it ?
Its is not that much of an emergency ...
Do it comfortably ... after that you can talk ...
Ma'am, are you giving referral for internship now ?
I have mentioned people for Facebook, if you are saying this
Last year, we posted and asked all queries of this type on the group 
On monday, I'll interview with that company
Yes, in this post you can put one more .
I love the photo of haridwar .
but not so obviously that i'm using it
didi found a site that allows rakhi delivery to uae
Do you know how many toffees we can get for 27 dollars ?
Yes, I and he were guessing that he would be surely seen
They were telling things about the HCU thing also.
like i got delayed at script showing , after that I didn't come online
Very dangerous politics is going on in HCU
You are looking back in form
When we are about to board the bus, we will take it
Now look, how do you not have stuff to download
Otherwise, such movies are not very special
Hey he makes a fun expression
That is why a poster is put up in the room
How can one be indoctrinate in his own movement
But these two gifs have surely done brain damage
She keeps staring creepy expressionless like this
I suggest you guys watch Mastijade's trailer
They are not giving a house inside the sector
Please do not miss the marriage functions .
I have a suspicion about the biryani of the hotel here
Just let me know beforehand that where should I come from the airport
He was, there was a plan to bait him there and then rape him
let me go through the venue and timings , then I will tell you in some time .
Take a look, I'm assuming staying in the night would be fun .
I'm guessing the ceremonies of 26th morn would start around 10
Yes but I'll arrange beer for 26th night in the hotel room .
He was saying the interview went okay only
I don't have to take any courses , but should I give tuition fees for thesis creds ? 
Even if I am not getting out, then also I will have to register 12
Yes this year I will be getting out I assume .
Oh, what is its relation with spam?
So I thought of asking you how this fellow was added in  the first place
Yes, that is why the people have problems being on his student life group
But there are so many that making a choice is difficult
Yes, the French speak in a tone of flow
Means let us change the sounds very smoothly , so it sounds classy .
It's not like I can get any French girl to fall for me
Everyone falls for the French girls
In Regular delivery, they have two weeks or so .
Oh I was not aware of the comments on the top
Hey tell me one thing , does it make sense for me to stand from there ?
But well we will get together sometime and talk regarding this
and for all i care, I'll ensure such an issue does not happen, but what you did was natural
He didn't know about your status, so I told him :/
Honestly, I do not understand what to write
Now do not induce upon me by overemphasizing your successes
I did run , but ran from rain , not in rain technically , if intent ever matters
if you are on campus , go once ask updates
any updates what is happening of our project ?
He said no reply came except that ,

Sallu bro, is your watch slow?
Bro, please come.
My father lives in Bombay. He once asked you for helping a book cancer patient and you did help him.
Bro, you are killing your younger brother.
Bro, it's 4.13. Where are you?
Maybe he is busy. That's why he has not come. Bro will come for sure. Bro has committed to us, so he will come for sure.
Sallu has forgotten everything. He doesn't remember anything.
It's 4.
Bro, come soon. I have been waiting since morning.
Sallu bhai will come. For sure.
Salmaaaan...Bro...live long.
Watching Bajrangi bhaijaan.
Salman bro is busy right now in the shoots of Satara. So, next time fans.
4.13 now.
Brother, please talk to us once.
It's 4 sir...come please.
Hi bro, how are you? If you are reading my comment then please reply once.
Bro has said that he is busy...till 6.
Bro, I am waiting for your film.
Why are you following the satan?
Do a favour for me, that never ask me to get married.
Bro, you joke very well.
He must have an important work to do.
Friend, please come quickly. It's 4.14 now.
Let's all go back to our homes. No salman is coming here.
Is it the case that bro, you will directly give us the news that you were married some years ago and you have kept this as top secret?
Your every style is different, sir.
Bro, give me your number, salman bro.
5000 comments in 5 minutes.
Probably, for him to come himself is impossible.
First 3.30 and then 4.00, and now 15 minutes are over bro.
If it was that easy to talk to salman khan, then it would have happened by now. He is very busy. He can't talk to people like this.
That's insane Pandey ji, you call us and then you vanish.
I love you. You are my favourite star. Nobody is like you. Proud of you. I love you.
Sir, when is the sequel of Wanted coming. Sir, first tere naam, then wanted, then dabang and now Bajrangi bhaijaan is coming.
Sallu bro, come to patiala for your film promotions.
The most unique question, how do you feel after doing Bajrangi bhaijaan?
Bro, when will you come. I haven't eaten since two days. Please come.
Motherfucker salman khan, your mother is a prostitue. Asshole. Infidel.
Now, where have you vanished?
Goodbye, salman.
Lol bro, when will you come? I think the servers have crashed.
Sir, we are waiting for you. Please talk.
Are you feeling shy to talk to me in front of everybody?
Will you reply?
Bro, where are you...Are you with Kat?
Salman bro has not come online yet?
Hello bro, please reply to me once. Please. Hello bro, please reply to me once. Please. Hello bro, please reply to me once. Please. Hello bro, please reply to me once. Please.
Now he will come and after saying good evening and good bye, he will go.
Or he will crash Facebook.
Now, it is 4.15. Do you not want to come?
What bro? Were you also lying? It's 4.14 pm now and you have not replied yet bro. Don't do that. We trust you...every time.
Salman bro, where are you? It's 4.15 now.
You're insane Pandey ji. Where are you?
Bro, please come.
Come quickly bro please.
Salman bro, sultan's shooting is currently on.
Where will you talk?
That's insane.
I am dying to talk to bro.
Nadim Shaikh's mother will come.
Salman bro...I have heard you have a back problem...May god fix your health very soon. Amen.
Please please please reply once.
Bro, even shahid is married now. When will you get married?
Bro, where did you go?
Don't do this.
I thought you always say the truth and that you are very nice but that is not the case at all.
Bro, I am hungry. But I am not going to eat, I will wait for you.
Salman khan is not on Facebook. He said this in his interview.
Asshole, don't you value other people's time.
Hiiii Sallu bro, I am a big fan, Sallu bro. I am the one who sends a message on twitter everyday. I am a big fan, Sallu bro. Reply please.
Bro, please marry.
It's 4 now but the meeting is still due.
I think some admin is duping us all.
Do it soon, bro.
Salman bro, I am your big fan... I am from Pakistan. Please please please please reply me one time... please waiting.
The way you find hanuman in Bajrangi's heart, you will find salman in everybody's heart.
That's enough waiting. If you want to talk to me, then inbox me.
I love you bro...Haters, please don't send message...because bro is always right. Wish you best of luck, salman bro.
I think the world's biggest fan of Sallu bro is me. Bro's friend is my friend. Bro's enemy is my enemy.Bro's bro is my bro. Bro's sis is my sis. Bro's wife is my...sister-in-law. :D
Hi guys, I am Sallu. I have changed my appearance.
Bro, come.
Love you Sallu.
Bro, did you not go to shahid's wedding?
Hello :) I can't wait anymore. Please come fast.
I give my full respect to susila aunt that she gave birth a superstar like you in India. Salute susila aunty.
Okay, that's fine. If you don't want to come, then tell us at least.
Bro, when will you come to Bihar or Patna? Please reply.
Aye sister's brothers, nothing that belongs to Sallu bro is fake...understood?
This is a lie.
You made me sad.
Hello brother. What are your expectations with Bajrangi bhaijaan? In this movie, you worship hanuman. Do you do that in real life also?
What happened bro?
Now please come.
Bro, you three make a great couple.
Don't say that to bhai. He must be busy, he will come.
Now, it's just one thing. Please come to Kolkata quickly.
Hello sir, where are you? Talk to me please.
Sir, I was standing outside your apartment for 7 days from morning to evening just to see you, but I could not see you.
Do your sisters and brothers love each other?
If you didn't want to do it, then why did you say that.
Come please...come please...bajrangi bhaijaan, please come.
Atleast change the profile pic. It has been 2 years. We change ours in your name everyday.
Everyone is done with the part...now rest everyone...bro is sleeping.
Bro, come now.
Bro, give me your twitter account's password please :P :P :P :P :P
Sallu, it's 4 now. Please come.
I am confused. Will you talk if we go offline?
Bollywood love, Bollywood fitness player, Bollywood king, Bollywood god.
Please, I am waiting for your reply and will keep on waiting. Promise.
It's 4.19. Where are you bro?
Salman khan, where are you?
Pandey sir, where are you. We all are waiting for your welcome here.
What bro, did you find some hottie?
That's insane Sallu sir...a reply is well deserved.
Salman khan, asshole. When would you have come. Leave it. Lolz.
Salman bro, you might be busy. No problem. I have to prepare for Iftaari. May god bless you. Bye.
Today, nobody's getting a reply. Salman sir duped us.
When does salman come and when does he go? Nobody knows.
We have been here to welcome you since so long, but you only don't come.
Salman sir, I can wait for you for my whole life.
Please Bajrangi bhaijaan, one reply please. I live in Rewa city of m.p. You said that help others, it will make you happy. But, by helping, it makes me even sadder. What should I do bro? Please reply bro.
you said help others and you will get happiness. but i get sad when i help people what should i do brother??? plz reply brother
Bro... it's 4 now. Where are you?
Attention! I have a formula to call Salman bro...just give 51 rupees and talk to Sallu bro..Take sage's sweets ... only 51 rupees.
Is this Salman's real id or is this a fake one? Salman sir has enough time to come here and talk to us. I think it's fake.
Bro, I am warning you in advance that you reply to me for sure. :-)
Bro, I am warning you in advance that you reply to me for sure. :-) You only said that you read all the comments. You must have read this also. :-D
Bro, please come.
I also want to talk, but how?
Sir, can this poor guy also get a reply, please?
Now, how much will you make us wait?
Fuck you. Quick, or else?
It came. Bro's reply came.
Did you sleep or what?
What Sallu bro, you told us to talk but you are not replying to anyone.
Brother, your just one reply is very important to me, because I am your devotee.
Bro, are you sick? Why are you so quiet?
Sir, please reply to us...we have been watching you since so long.
You're insane, Pandey ji...how much will you make us wait?
Why are you lying, bro?
It's 4 but where are your, sir? :(
Bro, I really loved the songs of your movie Bajrangi bhaijaan.
I am a very big fan of yours...we love you bro.
Brother's back is aching. Doctors have told him to take some rest. Okay friends
It's 4 but the party is still on. Salman khan didn't even reply to anyone let alone chat.
Bro must be busy with some work. He will surely come.
Is it not 4 on your clock?
Sorry friends, Salman sir is a bit busy right now. He will be coming in 5 minutes.
If you didn't want to come, then
Sir, will you come to Kashmir again? Please reply.
I am on Facebook, not on twitter. Please come.
Idiot, this is not real Salman khan. :-)
Salman bhai, we've been waiting for you. What happened?Talk to me. I love you, Salman bro.
After making so many fans nervous, how can you sleep?
Repeating the same question again and again is not feeling good.
Now come please, brother.
Bro, for your answer, I have to go very back.
Sir, I can't see your reply. :(
Bro, love. Whenever you will come, I'll come. I will send request to you. I got the link.

You're insane, salman sir. Do you plan on coming or not?
To get 17 inches biceps, what should I Do? Give me some tips.
Yes, it's all a lie. No salman khan is going to talk to us.
Sallu, it's a matter of phone number, sir. :P
Oh, I have waited too long. It's 4.23 sir.
What bro! Come bro, it's about to be evening, climate's changing, so why are we fighting? :P Where are you?
Brother, come please.
Salman sir, in one of your films, you should give the international rockstar Imran khan, a chance to sing.
Where do we chat, bro?
People, I have just heard the news that Salman khan said that his fans should not get sad. He is just coming.
Please, make my dream come true, bro.
Now, I don't have enough courage. Please start replying soon.
